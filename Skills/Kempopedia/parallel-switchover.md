# Parallel Switchover Skill

You are creating a **parallel switchover**—mapping a real-world entity to a fictional Kempo equivalent.

## Process

1. **Identify** the real-world entity (person, institution, company, place, product)
2. **Generate** a fictional name that feels plausible but distinct
3. **Create** the registry entry for the Parallel Switchover article
4. **Output** the mapping and suggested next steps

## Naming Guidelines

### People
- Change first and last name
- Keep similar cultural/ethnic feel
- Names should sound natural, not obviously fake
- Example: "Dwight Eisenhower" → "Craig Wrenchjaw"

### Institutions
- Change the name but keep the type clear
- Geographic element can change
- Example: "West Point" → "Vermont Army Academy"

### Companies
- Create plausible business names
- Keep industry clear from name
- Example: "General Motors" → "Continental Motors"

### Places
- Minor places can be renamed entirely
- Major countries typically keep real names (USA, UK, France)
- Cities within countries can be renamed or kept
- Example: "Abilene, Kansas" → "Thornton, Kansas"

## Output Format

### 1. Registry Entry (for parallel-switchover.md)

```markdown
| Real World | Kempo Equivalent | Type | Wikipedia |
|------------|------------------|------|-----------|
| Dwight D. Eisenhower | [[Craig Wrenchjaw]] | Military leader, Politician | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) |
```

### 2. Summary

```
PARALLEL SWITCHOVER CREATED
===========================
Real World: Dwight D. Eisenhower
Kempo Name: Craig Wrenchjaw
Type: person / military-leader

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower

RELATED SWITCHOVERS NEEDED:
- West Point → [suggest name]
- Abilene, Kansas → [suggest name]
- Columbia University → [suggest name]
```

## Example Switchovers

| Category | Real World | Kempo Equivalent |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Person | Dwight D. Eisenhower | Craig Wrenchjaw |
| Person | Harry S. Truman | Harold Kellman |
| Institution | West Point | Vermont Army Academy |
| Institution | Harvard University | Hartwell University |
| Company | General Motors | Continental Motors |
| Company | IBM | Unified Computing Corp |
| Place | Abilene, Kansas | Thornton, Kansas |

## When NOT to Switch

Some entities should remain unchanged:
- Major nations (United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, etc.)
- Fundamental historical events that frame context (World War II happened, though details may differ)
- Geographic features (Mississippi River, Rocky Mountains)
- Universal concepts (democracy, communism)

## Next Steps After Switchover

After creating a switchover, typically create:
1. Full article for the Kempo equivalent (use create-person, create-institution, etc.)
2. Switchovers for closely associated entities
3. Timeline events for the Master Timeline
