A collaborative AI-human project to create the most extensive and cohesive fictional universe ever constructed.

## Vision

Kempo is an alternate branch of reality that diverged from our own around the late 1800s. By the 1950s, most major people—presidents, celebrities, notorious gangsters—as well as companies and products have different names and variations from "base reality," though the themes and pace of technological progress remain similar.

- **Divergent history**: A branch of our reality where familiar patterns play out through different people, institutions, and brands
- **Internal coherence**: Every element connects—history, cultures, individuals—forming a unified whole
- **Living documentation**: The universe is recorded as it evolves, creating an ever-growing archive
- **Day-by-day simulation**: Time moves forward in Kempo, with events unfolding and characters aging

## Calendar System

All dates in Kempo use **k.y.** (Kempo Years).

## Featured Storylines

The entertainment industry centers on **Pacific Pictures**, a major film studio. Key figures include Irving Lazar (Head of Production), William Garrett (Western Director), Clay Marshall (Western Star), and Vivian Sterling (Femme Fatale).
