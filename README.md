# Kempo

A collaborative AI-human project to create the most extensive and cohesive fictional universe ever constructed.

**Live Site**: https://kempo.com
**Repository**: https://github.com/leorinaldi/kempo

## Purpose

Kempo is a living simulation—a new reality built day by day through iterative worldbuilding. Rather than creating a static fictional setting, this project evolves organically, with AI helping to maintain internal consistency, generate emergent narratives, and simulate the passage of time across an interconnected cosmos.

## Vision

- **Day-by-day simulation**: Time moves forward in Kempo, with events unfolding, characters aging, civilizations rising and falling
- **Internal coherence**: Every element connects—history, cultures, individuals—forming a unified whole
- **Emergent complexity**: Simple rules and interactions give rise to unpredictable, rich outcomes
- **Living documentation**: The universe is recorded as it evolves, creating an ever-growing archive of its reality

## Future Vision

As Kempo's simulated history expands beyond 1950, the project becomes an unprecedented creative and technological asset. A coherent alternate universe spanning decades of interconnected characters, institutions, and events across global industries represents ready-made source material for transmedia storytelling — novels, films, games, and interactive experiences can draw from an already-consistent world without the decades of retroactive canon-building that franchises like Marvel or Star Wars required. For AI research, Kempo serves as both a benchmark for narrative coherence and a case study in structured human-AI collaboration. But the most distinctive value lies in the "living simulation" model itself: a fictional universe where time advances and the future remains genuinely unwritten, creating emergent storytelling that even its creators cannot fully predict. Followers can engage with Kempo not as passive consumers of pre-authored fiction, but as witnesses to a world unfolding in real time — part encyclopedia, part slow-motion drama, part collaborative experiment in what storytelling becomes when humans and AI build history together.

## Calendar System

All dates in Kempo use **k.y.** (Kempo Year), which matches standard Gregorian years. For example, 1948 k.y. = 1948 AD.

**Current Date: January 1, 1950 k.y.**

The Kempo universe is a living simulation. The current date represents the "present day"—no events after this date have occurred yet. History before this date includes parallel switchover entities (fictional counterparts to real historical figures and institutions), meaning pre-1950 history is not identical to real-world history.

## Featured Storylines

Kempo's fictional universe is built through interconnected storylines spanning politics, entertainment, sports, and global affairs. Each storyline features parallel switchover characters—fictional counterparts inspired by real historical figures.

3. **Research Coming Period** — Update Real World Events for storyline inspiration
4. **Identify Fictional Amplifications** — Add themes to Possible Spawns
5. **Human Drama Amplification** — Develop everyday life storylines beyond major events
6. **Design Hybrid Characters** — Create Character Development Plan with 2-3 figure hybrids
7. **Prioritize Creation** — Tier characters by importance in development plan
8. **Execute Creation** — Create articles, generate images, update Spawn Registry

## Creating Articles

Articles are markdown files in `web/content/articles/` organized by type (people, places, institutions, etc.). Each article has YAML frontmatter and optional JSON infobox data.

### Article Format

```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
slug: "article-slug"
type: person | place | institution | event | timeline | concept
subtype: specific-subtype
status: published
tags:
  - relevant-tags
---

```json
{
  "infobox": {
    "type": "person",
    "image": {
      "url": "/media/article-slug.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption text"
    },
    "fields": {
      "Field_name": "value or [[wikilink]]"
    }
  }
}
```

Article content with [[wikilinks]] to other articles.
```

### Infobox Wikilinks

Infobox fields support wikilink syntax for linkable content:

```json
"Birth_place": "[[Lawton, Missouri]]",
"Political_party": "[[National Party]]",
"Education": "[[Liberty High School]]"
```

**Note**: Infobox field names must be capitalized (e.g., `Birth_place`, not `birth_place`).

Use wikilinks for places, institutions, and people. Use plain text for dates, numbers, and nationalities.

## Image Generation

Images are generated using the Grok API with comic book style prompts.

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.js <slug> "<prompt>"
```

### Prompt Style

All prompts start with: `Comic book illustration, bold ink lines, graphic novel style.`

| Article Type | Image Style |
|--------------|-------------|
| People | Portrait with setting/background |
| Nations | Flag waving against blue sky (full color) |
| Places | Scenic landscape or main street scene |
| Institutions | Logo or building depending on type |

### Color by Era

| Era | Color Style |
|-----|-------------|
| Pre-1955 | Black and white |
| 1955-1965 | Muted early color, slightly faded |
| 1965+ | Full color |

Nation flags are always full color regardless of era.

## Timeline Structure

The timeline is organized into separate pages:

- **Pre-1950**: Decade pages (1880s, 1890s, 1900s, etc.)
- **1950+**: Individual year pages (created when first event occurs)
- **Master Timeline**: Index linking to all decade/year pages

Date links in articles automatically route to the appropriate timeline page:
- `[[1945 k.y.]]` → links to 1940s decade page
- `[[1951 k.y.]]` → links to 1951 year page

## Skills

Skills are Claude prompts that guide article creation. Each skill has its own folder under `Skills/Kempopedia/` with a `skill.md` file.

### Global Rules (17 sections)

The `global-rules` skill contains core rules for all article creation:

1. **Current Date Rule** - January 1, 1950 k.y. is the present
2. **Real People vs Parallel Switchovers** - When to use real historical figures
3. **Character Reuse Before Creation** - Search existing characters before creating new ones
4. **No Dead Links** - Every wikilink must point to an existing article
5. **Infobox Field Naming** - Capitalized field names required
6. **Infobox Wikilinks** - Link syntax in infobox fields
7. **Wikilink Slug Consistency** - Pipe syntax for display names
8. **Political Parties** - National Party / Federal Party
9. **Real-World Event Articles** - Focus on Kempo divergences
10. **Parallel Switchover Completeness** - Create related switchovers
11. **Article File Organization** - Directory structure
12. **Frontmatter Format** - YAML metadata specification
13. **Registry Entry Format** - Spawn Registry syntax
14. **Image Generation** - Mandatory for Person/Place/Institution
15. **Second-Order Updates** - Update linked pages after creating articles
16. **Table Formatting** - Avoid markdown tables, use lists
17. **Media Content** - Audio/video embedding via JSON media array

### Type-Specific Skills

- **create-person** - Biographical articles with portrait images
- **create-place** - Places including nations (with flag images)
- **create-institution** - Organizations with logos or building images
- **create-media** - Songs, albums, and other cultural works with audio/video
- **create-timeline** - Decade and year timeline pages
- **generate-image** - Image prompt guidelines and color rules
- **parallel-switchover** - Mapping real-world entities to Kempo equivalents
