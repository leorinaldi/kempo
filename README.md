# Kempo

A collaborative AI-human project to create the most extensive and cohesive fictional universe ever constructed.

**Live Site**: https://kempo.com (private access - authorized users only)
**Repository**: https://github.com/leorinaldi/kempo

## Purpose

Kempo is a living simulation—a complete parallel reality built day by day through iterative worldbuilding. This is not our world with minor alterations, but an entirely separate cosmos with its own geography, nations, cultures, and history spanning from the dawn of civilization to the present day. The project evolves organically, with AI helping to maintain internal consistency, generate emergent narratives, and simulate the passage of time across an interconnected universe.

## Vision

- **Day-by-day simulation**: Time moves forward in Kempo, with events unfolding, characters aging, civilizations rising and falling
- **Internal coherence**: Every element connects—history, cultures, individuals—forming a unified whole
- **Emergent complexity**: Simple rules and interactions give rise to unpredictable, rich outcomes
- **Living documentation**: The universe is recorded as it evolves, creating an ever-growing archive of its reality

## Future Vision

Kempo represents an unprecedented creative and technological asset: a coherent parallel universe spanning millennia of interconnected characters, institutions, civilizations, and events. From ancient empires to modern nations like the Unified States of Arcadia, the entire arc of human development unfolds in a world that mirrors our own patterns while remaining wholly distinct. This represents ready-made source material for transmedia storytelling—novels, films, games, and interactive experiences can draw from an already-consistent world without the decades of retroactive canon-building that franchises like Marvel or Star Wars required. For AI research, Kempo serves as both a benchmark for narrative coherence and a case study in structured human-AI collaboration. But the most distinctive value lies in the "living simulation" model itself: a fictional universe where time advances and the future remains genuinely unwritten, creating emergent storytelling that even its creators cannot fully predict. Followers can engage with Kempo not as passive consumers of pre-authored fiction, but as witnesses to a world unfolding in real time—part encyclopedia, part slow-motion drama, part collaborative experiment in what storytelling becomes when humans and AI build history together.

## Calendar System

All dates in Kempo use **k.y.** (Kempo Year), which corresponds to Gregorian calendar numbering in terms of the passage of time since the common era began. For example, 1948 k.y. ≈ 1948 AD chronologically.

**Current Date: January 1, 1950 k.y.**

The Kempo universe is a living simulation. The current date represents the "present day"—no events after this date have occurred yet. The entire history of this parallel world, from ancient civilizations to the modern era, exists as a complete and internally consistent reality distinct from our own.

## Featured Storylines

Kempo's parallel universe is built through interconnected storylines spanning politics, entertainment, sports, and global affairs. While characters and institutions in Kempo may echo patterns familiar from our world, they exist as wholly original entities within their own reality.

npm install
npm run dev
```

The site runs at http://localhost:3000

**Note**: The site requires authentication. You must sign in with an authorized Google account to access any page. Configure allowed emails in `.env.local`:

```
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-email@gmail.com
```

## Creating Articles

Articles are markdown files in `web/content/articles/` organized by type (people, places, institutions, etc.). Each article has YAML frontmatter and optional JSON infobox data.

### Article Format

```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
slug: "article-slug"
type: person | place | institution | event | timeline | concept
subtype: specific-subtype
status: published
tags:
  - relevant-tags
---

```json
{
  "infobox": {
    "type": "person",
    "image": {
      "url": "/media/article-slug.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption text"
    },
    "fields": {
      "Field_name": "value or [[wikilink]]"
    }
  }
}
```

Article content with [[wikilinks]] to other articles.
```

### Infobox Wikilinks

Infobox fields support wikilink syntax for linkable content:

```json
"Birth_place": "[[Lawton, Missouri]]",
"Political_party": "[[National Party]]",
"Education": "[[Liberty High School]]"
```

**Note**: Infobox field names must be capitalized (e.g., `Birth_place`, not `birth_place`).

Use wikilinks for places, institutions, and people. Use plain text for dates, numbers, and nationalities.

## Image Generation

Images are generated using the Grok API with comic book style prompts.

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.js <slug> "<prompt>"
```

### Prompt Style

All prompts start with: `Comic book illustration, bold ink lines, graphic novel style.`

| Article Type | Image Style |
|--------------|-------------|
| People | Portrait with setting/background |
| Nations | Flag waving against blue sky (full color) |
| Places | Scenic landscape or main street scene |
| Institutions | Logo or building depending on type |

### Color by Era

| Era | Color Style |
|-----|-------------|
| Pre-1955 | Black and white |
| 1955-1965 | Muted early color, slightly faded |
| 1965+ | Full color |

Nation flags are always full color regardless of era.

## Timeline Structure

The timeline is organized into separate pages spanning from ancient history to the present:

- **Ancient & Medieval Eras**: Era-based pages covering major periods of civilization
- **Modern Era (pre-1950)**: Decade pages (1880s, 1890s, 1900s, etc.)
- **Contemporary Era (1950+)**: Individual year pages (created when first event occurs)
- **Master Timeline**: Index linking to all era/decade/year pages

Date links in articles automatically route to the appropriate timeline page:
- `[[1945 k.y.]]` → links to 1940s decade page
- `[[1951 k.y.]]` → links to 1951 year page

## Skills

Skills are Claude prompts that guide article creation. Each skill has its own folder under `Skills/Kempopedia/` with a `skill.md` file.

### Global Rules (17 sections)

The `global-rules` skill contains core rules for all article creation:

1. **Current Date Rule** - January 1, 1950 k.y. is the present
2. **Real People vs Parallel Switchovers** - When to use real historical figures
3. **Character Reuse Before Creation** - Search existing characters before creating new ones
4. **No Dead Links** - Every wikilink must point to an existing article
5. **Infobox Field Naming** - Capitalized field names required
6. **Infobox Wikilinks** - Link syntax in infobox fields
7. **Wikilink Slug Consistency** - Pipe syntax for display names
8. **Political Parties** - National Party / Federal Party
9. **Real-World Event Articles** - Focus on Kempo divergences
