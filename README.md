# Kempo

A collaborative AI-human project to create the most extensive and cohesive fictional universe ever constructed.

## Purpose

Kempo is a living simulation—a new reality built day by day through iterative worldbuilding. Rather than creating a static fictional setting, this project evolves organically, with AI helping to maintain internal consistency, generate emergent narratives, and simulate the passage of time across an interconnected cosmos.

## Vision

- **Day-by-day simulation**: Time moves forward in Kempo, with events unfolding, characters aging, civilizations rising and falling
- **Internal coherence**: Every element connects—physics, history, cultures, individuals—forming a unified whole
- **Emergent complexity**: Simple rules and interactions give rise to unpredictable, rich outcomes
- **Living documentation**: The universe is recorded as it evolves, creating an ever-growing archive of its reality

## Calendar System

All dates in Kempo use **k.y.** (Kempo Year), which matches standard Gregorian years. For example, 1952 k.y. = 1952 AD. The fictional history begins diverging from real-world history in 1950 k.y.

The Kempo universe will be documented through interconnected files covering:
- Timelines and historical records
- Nations, civilizations, and societies
- Characters and their stories
- Events, conflicts, and turning points
- Culture, technology, and daily life
