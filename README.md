# Kempo

A collaborative AI-human project to create the most extensive and cohesive fictional universe ever constructed.

**Live Site**: https://kempo.com (private access - authorized users only)
**Repository**: https://github.com/leorinaldi/kempo

## Purpose

Kempo is an alternate branch of reality that diverged from our own around the late 1800s. By the 1950s, most major people—presidents, celebrities, notorious gangsters—as well as companies and products have different names and variations from "base reality," though the themes and pace of technological progress remain similar. Larger cities and nations retain their real-world names, but colleges and smaller towns often don't. Kempo is a project to create and share this branch of the multiverse.

## Vision

- **Divergent history**: A branch of our reality where familiar patterns play out through different people, institutions, and brands
- **Internal coherence**: Every element connects—history, cultures, individuals—forming a unified whole
- **Living documentation**: The universe is recorded as it evolves, creating an ever-growing archive of this alternate reality
- **Day-by-day simulation**: Time moves forward in Kempo, with events unfolding and characters aging

## Future Vision

Kempo represents an unprecedented creative asset: an alternate timeline with interconnected characters, institutions, and events that diverged from our reality in the late 1800s. By the mid-20th century, this branch of the multiverse has developed its own presidents, movie stars, musicians, corporations, and cultural touchstones—all echoing familiar patterns while remaining distinct. This represents ready-made source material for transmedia storytelling—novels, films, games, and interactive experiences can draw from an already-consistent alternate history. The "living simulation" model means the future remains genuinely unwritten, creating emergent storytelling that even its creators cannot fully predict. Followers can engage with Kempo not as passive consumers of pre-authored fiction, but as witnesses to an alternate world unfolding in real time.

## Calendar System

All dates in Kempo use **k.y.** (Kempo Years).

## Featured Storylines

Kempo's alternate timeline is built through interconnected storylines spanning politics, entertainment, sports, and global affairs. Characters and institutions in Kempo echo patterns familiar from our world but have diverged into distinct entities since the late 1800s.

Search integrates with Giggle to find KempoNet apps alongside articles and pages.

### Simulation Management

The simulation management section is organized by time periods. Each period contains planning documents that guide the advancement of the Kempo universe for that era.

**Time Periods:**

| Period | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Pre-1948 | Coming Soon | Foundation era, background history |
| 1948-1950 | Active | Current simulation period |
| After 1950 | Coming Soon | Future periods as simulation advances |

**Planning Documents (per time period):**

| Document | Purpose | Process Step |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Simulation Advancement Approach | Overall methodology and step-by-step process | Orchestration |
| Spawn Registry | Completed parallel switchovers | Step 1 & 9 |
| Possible Spawns | Characters planned for future creation | Step 2 & 4 |
| Real World Events | Historical events for reference | Step 3 |
| Products, Companies & Culture | Brands and cultural entities | Step 5 |
| Human Drama Amplification | Romance, scandal, crime storylines | Step 6 |
| Character Development Plan | Proposed hybrid characters | Step 7 & 8 |
| Additional Tasks | Running list of ideas for future sessions | Notes |

**9-Step Advancement Process:**

1. **Review Current State** — Gap analysis using Spawn Registry
2. **Research Preceding Period** — Update Possible Spawns with historical figures
3. **Research Coming Period** — Update Real World Events for storyline inspiration
4. **Identify Fictional Amplifications** — Add themes to Possible Spawns
5. **Identify Product/Brand Needs** — Review Products, Companies & Culture gaps
6. **Human Drama Amplification** — Develop everyday life storylines beyond major events
7. **Design Hybrid Characters** — Create Character Development Plan with 2-3 figure hybrids
8. **Prioritize Creation** — Tier characters by importance in development plan

npm run dev
```

The site runs at http://localhost:3000

**Note**: The site requires authentication. You must sign in with an authorized Google account to access any page. Configure allowed emails in `.env.local`:

```
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-email@gmail.com
```

## Creating Articles

Articles are markdown files in `web/content/articles/` organized by type (people, places, institutions, etc.). Each article has YAML frontmatter and optional JSON infobox data.

### Article Format

```markdown
---
title: "Article Title"
slug: "article-slug"
type: person | place | institution | event | timeline | concept
subtype: specific-subtype
status: published
tags:
  - relevant-tags
---

```json
{
  "infobox": {
    "type": "person",
    "image": {
      "url": "/media/article-slug.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption text"
    },
    "fields": {
      "Field_name": "value or [[wikilink]]"
    }
  }
}
```

Article content with [[wikilinks]] to other articles.
```

### Infobox Wikilinks

Infobox fields support wikilink syntax for linkable content:

```json
"Birth_place": "[[Lawton, Missouri]]",
"Political_party": "[[National Party]]",
"Education": "[[Liberty High School]]"
```

**Note**: Infobox field names must be capitalized (e.g., `Birth_place`, not `birth_place`).

Use wikilinks for places, institutions, and people. Use plain text for dates, numbers, and nationalities.

## Image Generation

Images are generated using the Grok API with comic book style prompts.

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.js <slug> "<prompt>"
```

### Prompt Style

All prompts start with: `Comic book illustration, bold ink lines, graphic novel style.`

| Article Type | Image Style |
|--------------|-------------|
| People | Portrait with setting/background |
| Nations | Flag waving against blue sky (full color) |
| Places | Scenic landscape or main street scene |
| Institutions | Logo or building depending on type |

### Color by Era

| Era | Color Style |
|-----|-------------|
| Pre-1955 | Black and white |
| 1955-1965 | Muted early color, slightly faded |
| 1965+ | Full color |

Nation flags are always full color regardless of era.

## Timeline Structure

The timeline is organized into separate pages spanning from ancient history to the present:

- **Ancient & Medieval Eras**: Era-based pages covering major periods of civilization
- **Modern Era (pre-1950)**: Decade pages (1880s, 1890s, 1900s, etc.)
- **Contemporary Era (1950+)**: Individual year pages (created when first event occurs)
- **Master Timeline**: Index linking to all era/decade/year pages

Date links in articles automatically route to the appropriate timeline page:
- `[[1945 k.y.]]` → links to 1940s decade page
- `[[1951 k.y.]]` → links to 1951 year page

## Skills

Skills are Claude prompts that guide article creation. Each skill has its own folder under `Skills/Kempopedia/` with a `skill.md` file.

### Global Rules (17 sections)

The `global-rules` skill contains core rules for all article creation:

1. **Simulation Date Rule** - The current simulation date is the present
2. **Real People vs Parallel Switchovers** - When to use real historical figures
3. **Character Reuse Before Creation** - Search existing characters before creating new ones
4. **No Dead Links** - Every wikilink must point to an existing article
5. **Infobox Field Naming** - Capitalized field names required
6. **Infobox Wikilinks** - Link syntax in infobox fields
7. **Wikilink Slug Consistency** - Pipe syntax for display names
8. **Political Parties** - National Party / Federal Party
9. **Real-World Event Articles** - Focus on Kempo divergences
