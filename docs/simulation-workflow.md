# Simulation Workflow

The Kempo universe advances through a structured 9-step process organized by time periods.

## Time Periods

| Period | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Pre-1948 | Coming Soon | Foundation era, background history |
| 1948-1950 | Active | Current simulation period |
| After 1950 | Coming Soon | Future periods as simulation advances |

## Planning Documents

Each time period has these planning documents (accessible via `/admin/simulation`):

| Document | Purpose | Process Step |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Simulation Advancement Approach | Overall methodology | Orchestration |
| Inspirations | Completed real-world to Kempo mappings | Steps 1 & 9 |
| Possible Inspirations | Characters planned for creation | Steps 2 & 4 |
| Real World Events | Historical events for reference | Step 3 |
| Products, Companies & Culture | Brands and cultural entities | Step 5 |
| Human Drama Amplification | Romance, scandal, crime storylines | Step 6 |
| Character Development Plan | Proposed hybrid characters | Steps 7 & 8 |
| Additional Tasks | Ideas for future sessions | Notes |

## 9-Step Advancement Process

### Step 1: Review Current State
Gap analysis using Inspirations table. Identify what's been created and what's missing.

### Step 2: Research Preceding Period
Update Possible Inspirations with historical figures from the period before the current simulation date.

### Step 3: Research Coming Period
Update Real World Events for storyline inspiration based on what's about to happen.

### Step 4: Identify Fictional Amplifications
Add themes to Possible Inspirations—opportunities to amplify or diverge from real history.

### Step 5: Identify Product/Brand Needs
Review Products, Companies & Culture for gaps. What brands and products should exist?

### Step 6: Human Drama Amplification
Develop everyday life storylines beyond major historical events:
- Romance and relationships
- Scandals and controversies
- Crime and mystery
- Personal struggles and triumphs

### Step 7: Design Hybrid Characters
Create Character Development Plan with 2-3 figure hybrids. Combine traits from multiple real-world figures into single Kempo characters.

### Step 8: Prioritize Creation
Tier characters by importance in development plan:
- **Tier 1**: Essential for current storylines
- **Tier 2**: Supporting characters
- **Tier 3**: Background figures

### Step 9: Execute Creation
Create articles, generate images, update Inspirations table. Follow the article creation workflow:
1. Create article with frontmatter and infobox
2. Generate image
3. Create stub articles for new entities
4. Update timeline entries
5. Add backlinks to related articles
