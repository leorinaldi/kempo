## Notes for Collaboration

This Analysis document identifies approximately **25-30 new entities** needed to fully represent 1950 in the Kempo universe.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Discuss and finalize the highest-priority figures first (TV star, baseball star, McCarthy equivalent, second automaker)
2. Name each entity following the "compressed reality with a twist" principles
3. Research names for trademark/famous person conflicts
4. Build out backstories and connections
5. Iterate until the Kempo 1950 story feels complete

**Key questions for the user:**
1. What's the Kempo equivalent of the Korean War? Where does it take place?
2. Is Kellman still President in 1950? What party?
3. Which gaps feel most urgent to fill?
4. Any existing characters who should play bigger roles in 1950?
