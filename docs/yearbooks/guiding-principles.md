# Guiding Principles for Creating Kempo Yearbooks

**Scope:** Foundational philosophy and methodology for translating real-world history into the Kempo fictional universe.

---

## Purpose of Kempo Yearbooks

Kempo Yearbooks are **architectural planning documents** that serve as the north star for content creation. They define what happens in the Kempo universe for a given year, ensuring internal consistency while drawing inspiration from real-world history.

Each Kempo Yearbook guides the creation of:
- Kempopedia articles
- Publications (newspapers, magazines, books)
- Media (videos, audio, images)
- World data (people, organizations, brands, products, events, locations)

## Core Philosophy: Compressed Reality with a Twist

> "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes."
> "Kempo doesn't perfectly imitate reality, but it is a compressed version with a twist."

The Kempo universe is not a one-to-one mirror of reality. It is a **compressed, original interpretation** that captures the essence and themes of real history while creating something distinctly its own.

### Compression

Multiple real-world counterparts often combine into a single Kempo entity. **Default to blending 2-4 inspirations rather than creating 1-for-1 replacements.**

**Example:** Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Tony Bennett were three of many crooners in the 1950s. Rather than create separate Kempo versions of each, they compress into **Frank Martino** - a single figure who embodies the crooner archetype.

**More examples of successful compression:**
| Kempo Entity | Real-World Inspirations |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Frank Martino | Frank Sinatra + Dean Martin + Tony Bennett |
| Joe Rosetti | Joe DiMaggio + Ted Williams + Stan Musial |
| Bernie Kessler | Milton Berle + Arthur Godfrey |
| Know! Magazine | Time + Life |

This compression:
- Keeps the universe manageable
- Creates more impactful, memorable characters
- Allows one entity to carry the weight of an entire cultural phenomenon
- **Avoids a bloated cast of minor characters**

**When NOT to compress:** When characters need distinct narrative roles (hero vs. rival, mentor vs. protégé) or represent meaningfully different archetypes.

### The Twist

Kempo entities should feel **resonant but original**. They rhyme with reality without copying it.

**Example:** Camel cigarettes → Kempo equivalent

| Approach | Name | Assessment |
|----------|------|------------|
| Direct copy | Camel | Not allowed - trademark |
| Obvious parallel | Llama | Too close, already used in other fiction |
| Creative leap | **Koala** | Original, unexpected, allows fresh backstory |

The Koala name enables a new origin story (Australian tobacco ingredients) that parallels Camel's Middle Eastern connection while being wholly original. The cute, distinctive animal creates memorable branding that feels both familiar and fresh.

## Naming Principles

### For People

- Names should sound authentic to the character's ethnicity, era, and social class
- Combining elements of real-world inspirations is acceptable (Frank + Martino)
- Research proposed names to ensure they don't belong to famous real people in the same field
- The name should feel like it could have existed in that time and place
- **Research period-appropriate names**: Check what names were actually popular in the character's birth decade (e.g., "Lisa" was rare before 1960s; "Linda" was #1 in 1951)

**Synonym Decomposition Technique:** When a name is too close to the inspiration, break it into components and find synonyms:
- "Ridgway" (too close) → Ridge + Way → Hill + Ford → **Hillford**
- This creates distance while preserving the "feel"

### For Organizations, Brands, and Products

- No real trademarks or proprietary names
- Avoid obvious one-step parallels that other fictional universes have used
- Create names that have their own logic and backstory potential
- The name should evoke the right feeling without being derivative
- **Match naming theme to entity identity**: If the inspiration is a French surname company (Du Pont), use a French surname (Renard), not an arbitrary theme (Monarch)
- Avoid defaulting to royal/monarch/regal naming patterns unless thematically appropriate

### For Locations

- Real major cities and geographic features can be used (New York, Atlantic Ocean)
- Fictional cities replace real ones where needed (Motor City instead of Detroit)
- Create consistent naming conventions within regions
- Locations should feel geographically and culturally plausible

### Research Requirements

Before finalizing any name:
1. Search for existing trademarks in relevant categories
2. Check for famous real people with the name (especially in the same field)
3. Verify the name hasn't been prominently used in other major fictional universes
4. Confirm it feels appropriate to the era and context
5. **Check phonetic similarity**: Names that sound too close to the inspiration are problematic even if spelled differently (Ridgeway ≈ Ridgway)

## Kempo-Specific Terminology

Create unique Kempo terms for major real-world concepts. This reinforces that Kempo is a distinct universe.

| Real World | Kempo Equivalent |
|------------|------------------|
| Red Scare | **Red Panic** |
| Cold War | **Frozen War** |
| H-bomb (hydrogen bomb) | **O-bomb** (oxygen bomb) |

**Famous Quotes:** Paraphrase famous quotes rather than copying them verbatim. Keep the spirit, change the words.

| Real Quote (Omar Bradley) | Kempo Version (Bradley Omar) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| "Wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, wrong enemy" | "A misguided conflict, at a misguided moment, with a misguided adversary" |

---

## The Three-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Inventory

Before creating anything new, survey what already exists in the Kempo universe for the target year:

- **People** - Who is alive and active? What are their ages, roles, relationships?
- **Organizations** - What companies, studios, political parties, institutions exist?
- **Brands & Products** - What consumer goods and services are established?
- **Locations** - What cities, venues, and places have been created?
- **Events** - What has already happened that affects this year?
- **Media** - What films, songs, shows, publications already exist?

This inventory ensures internal consistency. We cannot contradict what has been established.

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

Compare the inventory against the Real [Year] Yearbook:

- What major historical themes have no Kempo equivalent?
- Which real-world newsmakers lack a Kempo counterpart?
- What cultural phenomena are missing?
- What industries or domains are underrepresented?

Prioritize gaps by:
1. Cultural significance (how important was this in real history?)
2. Storytelling potential (does this enable rich narratives?)
3. Connection to existing content (does this extend what we've built?)

### Phase 3: Creation

For each prioritized gap, propose Kempo equivalents following the compression and naming principles:

- Draft the entity with name, basic biography/description, and real-world inspiration
- Explain the compression logic (which real entities inform this?)
- Describe the "twist" that makes it original
- Identify connections to existing Kempo content
- Flag any research needed for name validation

## Consistency Rules

### Temporal Consistency

- Characters age appropriately year to year
- Events follow cause-and-effect logic
- Technology and culture progress realistically
- Storylines continue from where they left off

### Relational Consistency

- Characters who have met remember each other
- Organizations maintain their established structures
- Rivalries, alliances, and relationships persist logically
- Geographic and institutional relationships stay coherent

### Tonal Consistency

- The Kempo universe has its own voice and feel
- Compression should not create jarring anachronisms
- The "twist" should enhance, not undermine, believability
- Humor and drama should match the established tone

---

## What Kempo Yearbooks Are NOT

- **Not in-universe publications** (though they could be adapted into one later)
- **Not rigid scripts** - they guide creation but allow for discovery
- **Not encyclopedic** - focus on what matters for storytelling
- **Not one-to-one translations** - compression and originality are required

---

## The Two-Book System

The Kempo yearbook process produces **two distinct documents** for each year:

### Book 1: Kempo [YEAR] Yearbook Analysis

**Purpose:** The working document that shows the translation process.

**Audience:** Us (the creators)

**Contains:**
- Inventory of existing Kempo content relevant to the year
- Gap analysis comparing against the Real Yearbook
- New creation proposals with compression logic and naming rationale
- Research notes and name validation
- Content Creation Roadmap (explicit action items)

**Structure (per domain):**
1. Existing Foundation - What Kempo already has
2. Real-World Inspiration - Key points from Real Yearbook
3. Gap Analysis - What's missing
4. New Creations - Proposed entities with rationale
5. The Kempo Story - Synthesized narrative for this domain

**File naming:** `docs/yearbooks/kempo-YYYY-yearbook-analysis.md`

### Book 2: Kempo [YEAR] Yearbook

**Purpose:** The clean final output - what happened in Kempo that year.

**Audience:** Reference document; could become in-universe publication

**Contains:**
- Pure narrative of Kempo history for the year
- No process notes, rationale, or meta-commentary
- Reads as if written by a Kempo historian

**Structure:**
1. Introduction
2. Everyday Life
3. Entertainment & Culture
4. Sports
5. Business & Commerce
6. Organizations
7. Politics
8. International Affairs
9. Science & Technology
10. Publications
11. People of the Year
12. The Big Stories
13. Timeline

**File naming:** `docs/yearbooks/kempo-YYYY-yearbook.md`

## Relationship to Real Yearbooks

Each Kempo Yearbook pair should have a corresponding Real Yearbook as its foundation:

```
docs/yearbooks/the-real-1950-yearbook.md
            ↓
docs/yearbooks/kempo-1950-yearbook-analysis.md
            ↓
docs/yearbooks/kempo-1950-yearbook.md
```

The Real Yearbook provides:
- Historical context and themes
- Inspiration for characters and events
- Cultural touchstones to adapt
- Timeline of what happened when

The Analysis transforms this through:
- Inventory of existing Kempo content
- Gap identification
- New entity proposals with rationale
- Content creation planning

The final Yearbook presents:
- Original characters and entities
- Compressed, resonant narratives
- Fresh names and backstories
- A coherent fictional world

---

## Relationship to Simulation Planning Documents

The yearbook process should also reference these planning documents for pre-identified content needs:

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `possible-inspirations.md` | `web/content/admin/` | Pre-identified real-world figures to compress into Kempo characters |
| `character-development-plan.md` | `web/content/admin/` | Detailed character archetypes by tier (immediate, near-term, future) |
| `products-companies-culture.md` | `web/content/admin/` | Brands, products, and cultural elements needed |
| `human-drama-amplification.md` | `web/content/admin/` | Drama types, storylines, and settings that add texture |
| `real-world-events.md` | `web/content/admin/` | Historical events with Kempo adaptation notes |

**Integration points:**
- During Gap Analysis, cross-reference these documents for pre-identified needs
- After content creation, update these documents to mark what's been created
- Use these documents to ensure consistency across yearbook efforts

---

## Summary

Creating a Kempo Yearbook is an act of **creative translation**. We take the raw material of real history, compress it into manageable scope, apply original twists that make it distinctly Kempo, and ensure everything connects coherently to what came before and what will come after.

The two-book system separates **process** (Analysis) from **product** (Yearbook), giving us both the working documentation we need as creators and the clean output that represents our fictional world.

The result should feel like discovering an alternate history that could have been - familiar enough to resonate, original enough to surprise.
