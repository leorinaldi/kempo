### New Creations

*None needed - 1950 foundation sufficient for everyday life section*

### The Kempo Story

In 1951, the average Kempo family earns approximately $3,700 a year—up $400 from the previous year. Prosperity continues despite the Korean War. Gasoline costs about 23 cents a gallon, coffee runs 93 cents a pound, and a new Continental sedan costs around $1,600. The middle class continues expanding.

Television has become central to American life. By year's end, over 50% of Kempo households own a TV set—up from just 9% two years ago. Families gather nightly to watch Bernie Kessler, Dusty Dalton's adventures, and now new programs that are reshaping how Americans spend their evenings.

The suburban boom continues unabated. Lawrence Mitchell's Hartwell's opened three new suburban locations in 1950, and more follow in 1951. Young families continue flooding out of cities into new developments. The nuclear family ideal—father working, mother keeping house, children filling bedrooms—remains the expectation, even as reality proves more complicated.

The Korean War casts its shadow. Sons are called to serve. Gold Star banners appear in windows. Every family knows someone affected. Yet the war also brings prosperity—defense contracts, full employment, overtime pay. The contradiction of wartime abundance and wartime grief defines the year.

At Steel City's Hartwell Medical Institute, Dr. David Salter (37) continues his methodical work on the Rigorio vaccine. The childhood paralysis disease claimed over 3,000 lives last year. Parents dread summer, when epidemics strike. Salter's killed-virus approach inches forward, but success remains years away. At Kingsley Medical Institute, Dr. Albert Kovar pursues a rival live-virus approach. The race continues—and every summer, children are paralyzed.

### The Kempo Story

Television comes of age in 1951. The year's biggest sensation is *I Like Lisa*, which premieres on UBC in October. Lisa Warren, a 31-year-old comedienne from Dayton, Ohio, and her husband Rafael Morales, a Guatemalan-born bandleader, have created something revolutionary. Shot before a live studio audience with three cameras, the show captures spontaneous comedy in a way no previous program has achieved.

Lisa's physical comedy—the pratfalls, the rubber-faced expressions, the impeccable timing—makes her an instant star. Rafael's charm and his distinctive marimba-led orchestra provide the musical backbone. The premise is simple: Lisa forever schemes to break into show business, and Rafael forever tries to keep her out of the act. The chemistry between the real-life married couple is undeniable. By December, *I Like Lisa* is the highest-rated show in America.

Bernie Kessler (43) remains "Mr. Television"—his Tuesday night variety hour still draws millions. But the sitcom format that Lisa and Rafael have pioneered represents the future. Television is no longer just vaudeville with cameras; it's a new art form.

On Broadway, Goodwin & Langford unveil *The Emperor and the Lady* on March 29. Set in 1860s China, it tells the story of an American woman hired to tutor the Emperor's children—a clash of cultures, a meeting of minds, perhaps something more. Maxine Merrill (40), the brassy Queen of Broadway, transforms herself into a dignified yet spirited governess. The score includes instantly memorable songs. Critics rave. The show will run for years.

Frank Martino (35) continues his reign as the premier crooner. His name surfaced briefly in the Fletcher crime hearings—old debts to Sol Roth, a friendship with Sidney Hartman—but his fans remain loyal. The music plays on.

In bookstores, Ernest Beckford's *The Wanderers* arrives in July. The novel follows three generations of the Carver family—from Oklahoma drought to California's Central Valley, from desperate migrant labor to postwar suburban prosperity. Beckford's lean prose captures the American experience with unsparing honesty. Critics immediately recognize it as his masterpiece. It becomes a bestseller despite—or because of—its controversial frankness about poverty and exploitation.

Walter Hendricks' *Bramblewood* continues its remarkable rise, now appearing in over 300 newspapers. The gentle comic strip about woodland animals has become a national institution.

### The Kempo Story

Boxing in 1951 delivers two of the most memorable fights in the sport's history.

In July, Mickey Brennan finally does what everyone said he couldn't. At 37, after four failed title attempts, "The Southwark Southpaw" returns to Philadelphia for one last shot at Eddie Lawson's heavyweight crown. The city holds its breath. For six rounds, Lawson's technical mastery seems to be winning the day. Then, in the seventh, Brennan lands a left hook that sends the champion to the canvas. Lawson doesn't get up.

Philadelphia erupts. The beloved underdog who never quit, who kept coming back after every defeat, is finally heavyweight champion of the world. Brennan weeps openly in the ring. "I told you I had one more run in me," he says. He is the oldest man ever to win the heavyweight title.

In October, a different kind of drama unfolds. Joseph "Iron Joe" Carter, the greatest heavyweight of his generation, attempts a comeback at age 45. His opponent is Rocco Marchetti—undefeated, 23 consecutive knockouts, the most dangerous puncher in boxing. Marchetti grew up worshipping Carter. Now he must destroy him.

The fight is painful to watch. Carter, still proud, still skilled, simply cannot match Marchetti's power. In the sixth round, Marchetti lands a combination that puts Carter down. The referee stops it. Marchetti doesn't celebrate. He goes to Carter's dressing room afterward and cries.

"I never wanted to hurt him," Marchetti tells reporters, tears streaming. "He was my hero."

Carter, gracious in defeat, responds: "Kid, you're gonna be champion. Don't feel bad. This is how it should be."

By year's end, boxing has a new landscape: Brennan holds the title at 37, Marchetti is the #1 contender, and a collision course is set for 1952.

In baseball, Willie Banks completes his journey. The Cleveland Scouts, behind Banks' brilliant season, stage a late-summer surge to claim the Western League pennant. In the Championship Series, they face the New York Empires—a rematch of 1950, when the Empires prevailed. This time, the Scouts will not be denied. The series goes six games. Banks leads the way with his bat and his glove, and when the final out is recorded, Cleveland erupts. Willie Banks has his championship.

Joe Rosetti and the Empires fall short this year—gracious in defeat, already planning for next season. The rivalry between Banks and Rosetti, between Cleveland and New York, will continue. But for now, 1951 belongs to Willie Banks and the Cleveland Scouts.

*Note: These are moderate priority - can be created later if needed*

### The Kempo Story

The Kempo economy continues to boom in 1951, driven by Korean War defense contracts and consumer confidence. Continental Motors and Pioneer Automobile compete fiercely—Raymond Holbrook's 1951 Continental designs emphasize sleek chrome and tailfins, while Pioneer doubles down on engineering quality.

American Steel Corporation, under Warren Prescott, runs at full capacity. Korean War demand means overtime for steelworkers and profits for shareholders. The smokestacks of Steel City never stop.

Television advertising has transformed marketing. Companies spend unprecedented sums to reach captive audiences during Bernie Kessler's variety hour and Dusty Dalton's Western adventures. Lawrence Mitchell's Hartwell's uses TV spots to drive traffic to new suburban locations. The consumer economy accelerates.

The American Drivers Union, under Jack Callahan (38), remains the choke point of the American economy. Nothing moves without ADU truckers. Callahan's power grows—as do whispers about his connections to Salvatore Conti's organization. The Fletcher Committee hearings in March will shine light on some of these connections, but Callahan remains careful, his public image intact.

- Union membership peaked at ~30% of workers
- Veterans organizations politically powerful

### Gap Analysis

**None critical** - existing foundation covers needs

### New Creations

*None needed*

### The Kempo Story

The Fletcher Committee hearings in March 1951 captivate the nation. For two weeks, an estimated 30 million Americans watch as witnesses describe a hidden world of organized crime—bribery, murder, a national syndicate coordinating operations across cities.

Senator Russell Fletcher (49) methodically builds his case. Salvatore Conti (57) refuses to testify, citing the Fifth Amendment. Sol Roth's (49) financial genius is exposed. The connection between Sidney Hartman's (52) Lucky Sands Casino in Las Vegas and Eastern money becomes front-page news. Carmine DeMarco's (43) role as liaison between Tammany Hall and the syndicate draws gasps.

Frank Martino's name surfaces—his early-career debts to Sol Roth, his relationship with Sidney Hartman. The crooner issues a statement denying any wrongdoing. His fans believe him. His enemies store the information.

Jack Callahan's American Drivers Union faces scrutiny for pension fund loans to mob-connected casinos. Callahan testifies with careful answers, admits nothing, emerges unscathed—for now.

The hearings demonstrate television's power to focus national attention. Schools dismiss students to watch. Blood bank donations rise when facilities install TVs. By April, organized crime has been exposed to the American public as never before. The syndicate watches and waits. Conti counsels patience. Ferrante counsels violence. The tension grows.

Meanwhile, the American Veterans League, under Richard Tanner (43), continues its anti-communist advocacy. The AVL supports Senator Whitfield's investigations. With Korean War casualties mounting, the organization's voice carries special weight—these are men who served, and their sons are serving now.

### Gap Analysis

**Critical Gaps:**
- Need Westbrook firing storyline (Kellman-Westbrook clash)
- Need Rosenberg equivalent (spy trial)
- Need 22nd Amendment equivalent

### New Creations

**The Westbrook Firing:**
- Already established that Westbrook commands in Korea
- 1951 story: Westbrook publicly advocates expanding war into China, using atomic weapons
- Kellman insists on limited war, containment
- Westbrook writes to Congressional leader, letter read on floor
- **April 11, 1951: Kellman relieves Westbrook of command**
- Westbrook returns to hero's welcome, addresses Congress
- Senate hearings follow; generals contradict Westbrook
- Westbrook fades from headlines but remains politically viable for 1952

**Rosenberg Equivalent:**
- Proposal: **Victor and Helena Marsh** - married couple convicted of atomic espionage
- Victor: engineer at nuclear facility, passed secrets to Soviets
- Helena: typed notes, aware of husband's activities
- Trial: March 1951; Convicted: March 29; Sentenced to death: April 5
- Execution: 1953 (mirrors Rosenberg timeline)
- Names suggest "marsh" - murky, unclear, swampy moral terrain
- Controversy: Was Helena truly guilty or scapegoated?

**22nd Amendment Equivalent:**
- Proposal: **Presidential Term Amendment** or **Executive Tenure Amendment**
- Ratified February 1951
- Limits presidents to two terms
- Response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms (EXISTS in Kempo)

**Proposed Decisions:**
- [ ] Westbrook Firing: April 11, 1951 - Kellman relieves Westbrook
- [ ] Spy Trial: **Victor and Helena Marsh** - convicted March 29, 1951
- [ ] Constitutional Amendment: **Presidential Term Amendment** - ratified February 1951

- Stalemate continues through year's end

**Treaties:**
- ANZUS Treaty (September 1, 1951) - US, Australia, New Zealand
- Treaty of San Francisco (September 8, 1951) - Peace with Japan

### Gap Analysis

**None critical** - Korean War storyline transfers directly

### New Creations

*None needed - use real country names (Korea, China, Japan, Soviet Union)*

### The Kempo Story

The Korean War transforms in 1951. January begins with Chinese forces pushing UN troops south—Seoul falls for the third time. General Douglas Westbrook, commanding from Tokyo, insists he can win if given permission to strike at China directly. President Kellman refuses.

By March, UN forces under Westbrook's field commanders have recaptured Seoul. But Westbrook continues his public campaign for a wider war. He writes to Congressional leaders, gives interviews, issues ultimatums that contradict presidential policy.

On April 11, Kellman relieves Westbrook of command. The nation is shocked. Westbrook returns to a hero's welcome—ticker-tape parades, an address to Congress where he declares "old soldiers never die, they just fade away." For a moment, he seems poised to challenge Kellman politically.

But Senate hearings in May and June undercut him. The Joint Chiefs testify that they did not support Westbrook's strategy. General Omar Bradley's assessment becomes definitive: the MacArthur strategy would lead to "the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong enemy."

Meanwhile, the war continues. The Chinese Fifth Phase Offensive in April-May is blunted with catastrophic losses to the attackers. By July, the front has stabilized near the 38th parallel—roughly where it started. Armistice talks begin at Kaesong on July 10. They move to Panmunjom in October. The main sticking point: prisoners of war who refuse repatriation.

By year's end, the fighting has become a stalemate. Americans are dying for hills that serve no strategic purpose. The war cannot be won, cannot be abandoned—it can only be endured.

International treaties reshape the Pacific. The peace treaty with Japan (September 8) formally ends World War II. American troops will remain on Japanese soil. The Cold War in Asia has a new configuration.

- Nevada Test Site opened (January 27, 1951)
- Operation Greenhouse proved fusion concept (May)
- Teller-Ulam H-bomb design breakthrough (March)
- First nuclear-generated electricity (December 20, 1951)

**Medicine:**
- Polio epidemics continued (peak 1952)
- Three types of poliovirus confirmed (1951)
- EIS (Epidemic Intelligence Service) created 1951

### Gap Analysis

**Moderate Gaps:**
- No nuclear test site equivalent storyline
- No H-bomb development storyline

### New Creations

*Nuclear storyline can follow real history with Kempo names if needed. Not critical for 1951.*

### The Kempo Story

At Steel City's Hartwell Medical Institute, Dr. David Salter (37) continues his methodical work on the Rigorio vaccine. Summer 1951 brings another epidemic season—thousands of children paralyzed, hundreds dead. Parents keep children home from swimming pools, movie theaters, anywhere crowds gather. The iron lung has become a symbol of both terror and hope.

Salter's killed-virus approach shows promise in animal trials. At Kingsley Medical Institute, Dr. Albert Kovar pursues his rival live-virus method. The race continues. Success remains years away, but 1951 brings incremental progress.

In Nevada, the Atomic Energy Commission opens a new test site. Operation Ranger (January) conducts the first atmospheric tests on American soil. The mushroom clouds are visible from Las Vegas. The atomic age advances.

At secret facilities, scientists work on the next generation of nuclear weapons. The hydrogen bomb—a thousand times more powerful than the Hiroshima weapon—is now theoretically possible. The arms race with the Soviet Union accelerates.

Leonard Vance (43), the former government scientist who left research in 1950, teaches physics at a small college. He says nothing about what he knows. The questions about Antelope Springs remain unanswered. The truth waits.

## IX. Publications

### Existing Foundation

**Newspapers:**
- New York Standard (implied)

**Magazines:**
- Know! Magazine - Arthur Hale (52), Eleanor Brooks (45) photographer
- Implied other magazines exist

**Books:**
- Ernest Beckford (52) - major novelist, working on California epic

**Comics:**
- *Bramblewood* by Walter Hendricks (31) - debuted October 1950, syndication growing

### Real-World Inspiration

From the Real 1951 Yearbook:
- *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger (July 16, 1951)
- Dennis the Menace comic debuts (1951)
- Beetle Bailey joins Army (1951)

### Gap Analysis

**Critical Gaps:**
- Need *Catcher in the Rye* equivalent novel

**Moderate Gaps:**
- Need new comic strip for 1951

### New Creations

**Novel - Catcher equivalent:**

Proposal: **Ernest Beckford's *The Wanderers*** - his California multi-generational epic
- Published mid-1951
- Follows three generations of a farming family from Dust Bowl to postwar prosperity
- Lean prose, unflinching portrayal of poverty and survival
- Critically acclaimed, controversial for frank treatment of migrant experience
- Immediate bestseller; considered his masterpiece

Alternative: New young author with alienation novel
- Proposal: ***The Outsider*** by **Daniel Kaye** (new character)
- 32-year-old author, WWII veteran, captures postwar alienation
- Published July 1951
- Becomes cult classic among teenagers

**Recommendation:** Use Beckford's *The Wanderers* as the major literary event, as it's already set up in 1950 analysis.

**Comic Strip:**

Proposal: **Ned & Ginger** by new artist - family comedy strip debuting 1951
- Or: *Bramblewood* continues growing (already have this)

**Proposed Decisions:**
- [ ] Novel: Ernest Beckford publishes ***The Wanderers*** (July 1951) - his California epic, immediate classic
- [ ] Comics: *Bramblewood* syndication expands dramatically in 1951 (no new strip needed)

### The Kempo Story

In July 1951, Ernest Beckford (52) publishes *The Wanderers*, his California epic. The novel follows three generations of the Carver family—from Oklahoma drought to California's Central Valley, from desperate migrant labor to postwar suburban prosperity. Beckford's lean prose, honed over a decade, captures the American experience with unsparing honesty.

*The Wanderers* is immediately recognized as a masterpiece. Critics compare it to the greatest American novels. It becomes a bestseller despite—or because of—its controversial frankness about poverty, exploitation, and the compromises of survival. Beckford, writing from his cottage in Pacific Grove, has produced the definitive novel of the American West.

Walter Hendricks' *Bramblewood* continues its remarkable rise. By year's end, the gentle comic strip about woodland animals appears in over 200 newspapers. Thistle the anxious rabbit, Ash the guarded fox, and their friends have touched something in the American heart. In an era of anxiety, the strip offers warmth without saccharine—small triumphs, small heartbreaks, the daily courage of growing up.

Know! Magazine, under Arthur Hale (52), covers the year's major stories: the Westbrook firing, the Fletcher hearings, the Korean stalemate. Eleanor Brooks' (45) photographs capture the era's contradictions—suburban prosperity and Gold Star grief, television glamour and crime committee testimony.

## XI. The Big Stories

### 1. The Westbrook Firing

**What happens:** On April 11, 1951, President Harold Kellman relieves General Douglas Westbrook of command in Korea. Westbrook had repeatedly defied presidential orders, advocating publicly for expanding the war into China and using atomic weapons.

**Real-world inspiration:** Truman-MacArthur confrontation

**Domains touched:** Politics, Military, Media

**Key people:** Harold Kellman, Douglas Westbrook, (generals who testify)

**Seeds planted:** Westbrook remains politically viable for 1952 election; civilian control of military affirmed

### 2. The Fletcher Crime Hearings

**What happens:** In March 1951, Senator Russell Fletcher's televised crime hearings captivate 30 million Americans. For the first time, the hidden world of organized crime is exposed to public view.

**Real-world inspiration:** Kefauver Committee hearings

**Domains touched:** Politics, Crime, Entertainment (television), Business (Jack Callahan/ADU)

**Key people:** Russell Fletcher, Salvatore Conti, Sol Roth, Sidney Hartman, Carmine DeMarco, Frank Martino (mentioned), Jack Callahan (testifies)

**Seeds planted:** Organized crime exposed but not destroyed; Callahan survives; tension between Conti and Ferrante grows

### 3. The Korean Stalemate

**What happens:** After the chaotic retreat of late 1950, the front stabilizes near the 38th parallel. Armistice talks begin in July but stall over prisoner repatriation. Fighting continues—Americans die for hills that serve no purpose.

**Real-world inspiration:** Korean War 1951

**Domains touched:** Military, Politics, Everyday Life

**Key people:** Harold Kellman, Douglas Westbrook (until April), military commanders

**Seeds planted:** War continues into 1952; shapes political landscape

### 4. Television's Triumph

**What happens:** Television ownership passes 50%. New programming (sitcom equivalent to I Love Lucy) revolutionizes the medium. The Fletcher hearings demonstrate TV's power to focus national attention.

**Real-world inspiration:** I Love Lucy debut, TV adoption, Kefauver hearings

**Domains touched:** Entertainment, Business, Politics

**Key people:** Bernie Kessler, (new sitcom star), Russell Fletcher

**Seeds planted:** TV becomes dominant medium; advertising transformed

### 5. The Spy Trial

**What happens:** Victor and Helena Marsh are convicted of atomic espionage on March 29, 1951, and sentenced to death on April 5. The case divides America—traitors who deserve execution, or victims of hysteria?

**Real-world inspiration:** Rosenberg trial

**Domains touched:** Politics, Science, Society

**Key people:** Victor Marsh, Helena Marsh, Robert Whitfield (exploits politically)

**Seeds planted:** Execution scheduled for 1953; ongoing controversy

## XV. Comprehensive Entity Gap Analysis

This section systematically identifies ALL entities from the Real 1951 Yearbook that don't yet exist in Kempo.

---

### A. MILITARY - CRITICAL GAPS

| Real Figure | Role | Kempo Status | Priority |
|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Matthew Ridgway** | General who replaced MacArthur, stabilized Korean front | **MISSING** | CRITICAL |
| **Omar Bradley** | Chairman of Joint Chiefs, "wrong war" testimony | **MISSING** | CRITICAL |
| **Charles Turner Joy** | Vice Admiral, led armistice negotiations | **MISSING** | HIGH |
| Douglas MacArthur | Fired general | EXISTS: Douglas Westbrook | ✓ |

**Why Ridgway is Critical:**
In real 1951, Ridgway replaced MacArthur and competently stabilized the front. His professional, non-grandstanding leadership contrasted sharply with MacArthur. Without a Ridgway equivalent, our Korean War story has a gap—who commands after Westbrook is fired?

**Why Bradley is Critical:**
Bradley delivered the famous "wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, wrong enemy" line that deflated MacArthur. We reference this line in our analysis but haven't created the character who says it.

**Proposals:**

1. **General Marcus Ridgeway** (Ridgway equivalent)
   - Born ~1895 (age 56 in 1951)
   - West Point, served in WWI and WWII
   - Replaces Westbrook as UN Commander April 1951
   - Professional, competent, no grandstanding
   - Stabilizes front, begins armistice talks
   - Name: "Ridgeway" rhymes with Ridgway

2. **General Thomas Prescott** (Omar Bradley equivalent)
   - Born ~1893 (age 58 in 1951)
   - Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff
   - Testifies at Senate hearings, contradicts Westbrook
   - Delivers the "wrong war" assessment
   - Name: Prescott suggests prestige, connection to existing Warren Prescott (American Steel)?

3. **Vice Admiral Charles Sterling** (Charles Turner Joy equivalent)
   - Born ~1895 (age 56 in 1951)
   - Leads UN delegation at armistice negotiations
   - Professional diplomat-warrior
   - Name: Sterling suggests integrity, naval tradition

---

### B. BUSINESS - MAJOR GAPS

| Real Entity | Role | Kempo Status | Priority |
|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **AT&T** | Telecom giant, first 1M stockholders | **MISSING** | CRITICAL |

| **Diners Club** | First credit card | **MISSING** | MODERATE |
| **Chase-Manhattan merger** | Banking consolidation | **MISSING** | LOW |
| General Motors | Auto giant | EXISTS: Continental Motors | ✓ |
| US Steel | Steel producer | EXISTS: American Steel Corp | ✓ |

**Why AT&T is Critical:**
Telecommunications is a massive gap in our corporate landscape. In 1951, AT&T became the first corporation with 1 million stockholders. Phone calls were expensive ($2.50 for 3 minutes coast-to-coast). We have no telecom company.

**Proposals:**

1. **American Telephone Corporation (ATC)** or **Continental Telephone Company**
   - Monopoly telecom provider (like AT&T's Bell System)
   - Founded late 1800s
   - By 1951: first corporation with 1 million stockholders
   - Long distance calls expensive
   - CEO: Need to create
   - Research subsidiary (like Bell Labs) for innovation storylines

2. **Monarch Chemical Company** (Du Pont equivalent)
   - Major chemical/industrial company
   - "Better things for better living" type slogan
   - Employs more chemists than universities
   - Defense contracts, consumer products
   - Founded late 1800s

3. **Executive Club Card** or **Carte Blanche** (Diners Club equivalent)
   - First credit card, founded 1950
   - Started for restaurant dining
   - Expanding in 1951
   - Represents new consumer credit era

### C. POLITICS - GAPS

| Real Figure | Role | Kempo Status | Priority |
|-------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Joseph Martin** | House Minority Leader, read MacArthur's letter | **MISSING** | HIGH |
| **Irving Kaufman** | Judge who sentenced Rosenbergs | **MISSING** | MODERATE |
| Truman | President | EXISTS: Harold Kellman | ✓ |
| McCarthy | Red Scare senator | EXISTS: Robert Whitfield | ✓ |
| Kefauver | Crime investigator | EXISTS: Russell Fletcher | ✓ |

**Proposals:**

1. **Representative Howard Clayton** (Joseph Martin equivalent)
   - House Minority Leader (Federal Party)
   - Born ~1895 (age 56 in 1951)
   - Massachusetts or similar state
   - Reads Westbrook's letter on House floor April 5, 1951
   - Sympathetic to Westbrook but ultimately loyal to civilian control

2. **Judge Samuel Feldman** (Irving Kaufman equivalent)
   - Federal judge who presides over Marsh trial
   - Sentences Victor and Helena Marsh to death
   - Controversial figure - praised by anti-communists, criticized by civil libertarians
   - Born ~1905 (age 46 in 1951)

| Rodgers & Hammerstein | Broadway composers | EXISTS: Goodwin & Langford | ✓ |

- Nat King Cole (Black singer, sophisticated, "Too Young")
- Tony Bennett (Italian-American, emotional singing)
- Les Paul (guitar innovator, multi-track recording)
- Patti Page (female vocalist)
- Johnnie Ray (emotional, theatrical)

**Proposals:**

| **Alexander Langmuir** | EIS founder | **MISSING** | LOW |
| Jonas Salk | Polio researcher | EXISTS: David Salter | ✓ |

   - Passionate advocate for H-bomb development
   - Controversial figure - brilliant but difficult
   - Works at secret facility

| Bobby Thomson | "Shot Heard Round World" | N/A - using different storyline | - |

**Proposals:**

We're using a different baseball storyline (Scouts vs Empires rematch, Banks wins championship), so we don't need the Thomson/Branca drama. But we might want:

1. **Giuseppe "Joe" DiMarco** (DiMaggio equivalent)
   - Born ~1914 (age 37 in 1951)

### Championship Series Decision

**1951 Championship Series: Cleveland Scouts vs. New York Empires**

The Scouts (Western League) face the Empires (Eastern League) in a rematch of the 1950 series (which the Empires won 4-2). This creates maximum drama:
- Willie Banks vs. Joe Rosetti - the two best players in baseball
- Banks seeking redemption after 1950 loss
- Rosetti's Empires seeking repeat championship
- Scouts win in 6 games - Banks earns his ring, Rosetti gracious in defeat
- Completes the "barrier-breaking triumph" narrative
