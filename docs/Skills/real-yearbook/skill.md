# Real Yearbook Skill

Create comprehensive historical reference documents for specific years, gathering true real-world data to serve as inspiration for Kempo content.

## Purpose

Real Yearbooks are internal reference documents that capture what actually happened in a given year. They provide the factual foundation from which Kempo storylines, characters, and entities are inspired.

**Key distinction:** These document *real* history, not Kempo fiction. They are titled "The Real [YEAR] Yearbook" to distinguish from the fictional Kempo universe.

## Primary Source: Grokipedia

**Grokipedia is the primary research source for Real Yearbooks.**

For each section, query Grokipedia systematically:
- Ask for comprehensive information about the topic for the specific year
- Follow up with targeted questions to fill gaps
- Cross-reference between sections to identify connecting themes

Example queries:
- "What were the top movies of 1950?"
- "Who were the most famous athletes in 1950?"
- "What was everyday life like for the average American family in 1950?"
- "What were the major political events in the US in 1950?"

**Queries for new texture sections:**
- "Who was the FBI director in 1950 and what was he known for?"
- "Who ran the major TV networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) in 1950?"
- "Who were the major movie studio heads in 1950?"
- "What were the top cigarette, beer, and soft drink brands in 1950?"
- "What were the most famous nightclubs in Hollywood and New York in 1950?"
- "What celebrity romances and scandals made headlines in 1950?"
- "What was Las Vegas like in 1950 and who ran the casinos?"
- "How did the Klaus Fuchs arrest lead to the Rosenberg case?"

2. **Entertainment** - Query for top movies, TV shows, music, cultural trends
3. **Sports** - Query for championships, athletes, sports news
4. **Business** - Query for major companies, products, economic conditions
5. **Organizations** - Query for influential groups and institutions
6. **Domestic Politics** - Query for political events, legislation, elections
7. **International** - Query for foreign policy, military, global events
8. **Science/Tech** - Query for breakthroughs, inventions, innovations
9. **Publications** - Query for bestsellers, major newspapers, magazines
10. **Key Institutional Figures** - Query for who ran FBI, CIA, studios, networks, unions
11. **Consumer Brand Landscape** - Query for top brands in cigarettes, beer, soft drinks, airlines, cars, etc.
12. **Celebrity News & Human Drama** - Query for celebrity romances, scandals, divorces, feuds
13. **Key Settings & Crossroads** - Query for famous nightclubs, hotels, mob hangouts
14. **Event Causality Chains** - Trace how major events connected to each other
15. **People** - Compile notable figures from all sections
16. **Big Stories** - Identify 3-5 connecting narratives
17. **Timeline** - Compile chronological event list

### Phase 2: Writing

1. Write each section based on research gathered
2. Keep tone factual and reference-oriented
3. Focus on what's useful for Kempo inspiration
4. Include specific names, dates, and details

### Phase 3: Introduction

Write the Introduction LAST after all sections are complete:
- Synthesize the year's major themes
- Capture the mood and zeitgeist
- Highlight what made this year distinctive
- Preview the big stories

### Phase 4: Review

- Verify completeness of all sections
- Check for gaps or thin areas
- Ensure cross-references between sections
- Confirm timeline covers all domains

**Texture Section Review:**
- [ ] Institutional Figures: Do we know who ran FBI, CIA, major studios, networks?
- [ ] Consumer Brands: Do we have top brands in each category (cigarettes, beer, soft drinks, cars, airlines)?
- [ ] Celebrity Drama: Do we have romances, scandals, feuds documented?
- [ ] Key Settings: Do we have specific nightclubs, hotels, venues named?
- [ ] Causality Chains: Do we trace how major events connected?

## Style Guidelines

- **Factual, not interpretive** - State what happened, not opinions
- **Specific over general** - Names, dates, numbers when available
- **US-centric** - International events from American perspective of the time
- **Scannable** - Use headers, bullets, and clear organization
- **No citations needed** - Internal reference document
- **No images** - Text only

## Versioning

If significant new information is discovered later, update the yearbook rather than creating a new version. Add a note at the top:

```markdown
> Last updated: [DATE] - Added [what was added]
```
