**Feldmann Beer** is an American lager produced by the [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing Company]] of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. Introduced in [[1856 k.y.]], Feldmann is the best-selling beer in the United States as of [[1950 k.y.]], known for its smooth taste, consistent quality, and working-class appeal.

## History

### Origins

Heinrich Feldmann founded his [[Milwaukee]] brewery in 1856, bringing traditional Bavarian lager-brewing techniques to America. His original recipe emphasized long cold-lagering periods—storing the beer in cool caves for months to develop smoothness and clarity. This patience paid off in a distinctively clean, crisp lager that stood apart from the hastily brewed beers common at the time.

### Rise to prominence

The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 introduced Feldmann Beer to a massive new market when Heinrich shipped trainloads of beer to the thirsty, devastated city. From that point forward, Feldmann expanded aggressively, using refrigerated railcars to ship beer nationwide while maintaining freshness.

By 1900, Feldmann Beer had become one of America's top-selling beers. The brand's reputation for quality and value made it the beer of choice for working-class Americans from coast to coast.

### Prohibition survival

During Prohibition (1920–1933), [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing]] survived by producing near beer and malt syrup. When repeal came, the company was ready. Within months, Feldmann Beer was back on shelves and in taverns across America.

### Wartime distribution

During [[world-war-ii#morale|World War II]], Feldmann Beer was shipped to American troops stationed overseas. For millions of servicemen, cracking open a Feldmann was a taste of home. This wartime exposure cemented brand loyalty among a generation who returned home as devoted Feldmann drinkers.

## Product characteristics

### Brewing process

Feldmann Beer is brewed according to Heinrich Feldmann's original Bavarian methods:

- **Water**: Pure Wisconsin spring water from artesian wells
- **Malt**: Premium two-row barley, malted in-house
- **Hops**: A blend of domestic and imported hops for balanced bitterness
- **Yeast**: The original Feldmann lager yeast strain, maintained since 1856
- **Lagering**: Extended cold storage for a minimum of six weeks

### Taste profile

Feldmann Beer is characterized by:

- Clean, crisp finish
- Mild hop bitterness
- Subtle malt sweetness
- Light golden color
- Moderate carbonation

The result is an approachable, refreshing lager that pairs well with hearty American fare—steaks, burgers, and tavern food.

## Packaging

Feldmann Beer is sold in:

- **Bottles**: Brown glass bottles (12 oz), sold individually or in six-packs
- **Cans**: Steel cans (12 oz), introduced 1935
- **Draft**: Wooden kegs for taverns and bars

The Feldmann label features the brewery's Germanic crest and the "For the man who sweats!" slogan in bold lettering.

## Advertising

### "For the man who sweats!"

Feldmann's signature slogan, introduced in the 1930s, positions the beer as the drink of hardworking Americans. Advertisements typically feature workingmen—factory workers, farmers, construction crews—relaxing with a cold Feldmann after a hard day's work.

"You've earned it. For the man who sweats!"

### Radio sponsorship

Feldmann Brewing sponsors several radio programs, including sports broadcasts and comedy shows. The familiar Feldmann jingle is recognized nationwide.

### Sports marketing

Feldmann Beer is closely associated with baseball, sponsoring several major league teams and their radio broadcasts. The company's advertisements frequently feature baseball imagery, connecting the beer with America's pastime.

### Television advertising

With the rapid growth of television in the late 1940s, [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing]] moved quickly into the new medium. Feldmann television commercials emphasize the brand's working-class appeal, featuring scenes of honest laborers enjoying their reward at the end of the day.
