The **Continental Model C** was an economy automobile produced by [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]] from [[1908 k.y.]] to [[1927 k.y.]] Designed by company founder [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]], the Model C is widely credited with "putting America on wheels" by making automobile ownership affordable for ordinary working families. Over its nineteen-year production run, approximately 15 million Model Cs were built, making it one of the most successful automobiles in history.

The Model C's revolutionary assembly line manufacturing, introduced in [[1913 k.y.]], transformed not only the automobile industry but industrial production worldwide. The car's combination of low price, rugged reliability, and ease of repair made it the vehicle that defined early 20th-century American mobility.

## Development

By 1907, [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] had spent years experimenting with automobile designs at [[continental-motors|Continental Motors]]. While the company had produced several models, none had achieved the mass-market success Durant envisioned. He dreamed of building a car that any American worker could afford—not a luxury item for the wealthy, but practical transportation for farmers, shopkeepers, and factory workers.

Durant assembled a small team of engineers to design what would become the Model C. Working in a small room at the Piquette Avenue plant in [[Detroit]], the team focused on three principles: simplicity, durability, and affordability. Every component was evaluated for cost and reliability. The result was a car stripped of unnecessary complexity—easy to build, easy to drive, and easy to repair.

The first production Model C rolled off the line on October 1, [[1908 k.y.]]

## Design

### Chassis and body

The Model C featured a simple but robust ladder-frame chassis with a 100-inch wheelbase. The body was mounted high off the ground—a deliberate choice that allowed the car to navigate the rutted, unpaved roads that characterized rural America in the early 20th century. Durant reportedly insisted on testing prototypes on the worst roads he could find.

The car was offered in several body styles over its production run:

- **Runabout**: A two-seat open car, the most affordable Model C
- **Touring Car**: A five-seat open car with a folding canvas top
- **Coupe**: An enclosed two-seat body for year-round driving
- **Sedan**: An enclosed four-door body, introduced in later years
- **Town Car**: A luxury variant with chauffeur's compartment

Early Model Cs featured brass radiators, headlamps, and trim that required regular polishing. By 1916, these were replaced with more practical painted and enameled components.

### Engine and powertrain

The Model C was powered by the "Continental Four"—a water-cooled inline four-cylinder engine displacing 177 cubic inches (2.9 liters). The engine produced 20 horsepower at 1600 rpm, adequate for the car's light weight of approximately 1,200 pounds.

Key engine features included:
- **Detachable cylinder head**: Simplified maintenance and repair
- **One-piece cylinder block**: Reduced manufacturing complexity
- **Vanadium steel construction**: Lighter and stronger than conventional steel
- **Gravity-fed fuel system**: No fuel pump required
- **Magneto ignition**: Reliable spark generation without batteries

The transmission was a two-speed planetary unit operated by foot pedals rather than a conventional gear lever. While considered unusual, the system was intuitive once learned and required minimal maintenance.

### Notable features

The Model C incorporated several advanced features for its time:
- **High ground clearance**: Essential for unpaved roads
- **Transverse leaf spring suspension**: Simple and durable
- **Hand-crank starting**: Standard until electric starters became available
- **Interchangeable parts**: Any Model C component would fit any other Model C

## Assembly line production

### The Lakeside Plant revolution

The Model C's most lasting impact came not from the car itself but from how it was built. In [[1913 k.y.]], Durant introduced the moving assembly line at Continental's new [[lakeside-plant|Lakeside Plant]] in [[Detroit]]. Rather than having workers move from car to car, the cars moved past stationary workers, each performing a single specialized task.

The results were dramatic. Assembly time for a single Model C dropped from over twelve hours to just ninety-three minutes. As efficiency improved, prices fell. The touring car that cost $850 in 1908 sold for just $290 by 1924.

### The Five Dollar Day

On [[January 5, 1914 k.y.]], Durant stunned the industrial world by announcing that Continental would pay its factory workers $5 per day—more than double the prevailing wage of $2.34. Critics called him a socialist and predicted bankruptcy.

Durant's reasoning was characteristically pragmatic. The assembly line's repetitive work caused high turnover; workers quit constantly. The Five Dollar Day solved this problem overnight. Applications flooded in, and Continental could select the best workers. Moreover, Durant pointed out, well-paid workers could afford to buy the cars they built, expanding the market for Model Cs.

The Five Dollar Day established Durant's reputation as an industrial innovator and helped cement the Model C's image as "the people's car."

## Production history

### Early years (1908–1913)

Production ramped up steadily from the Model C's 1908 introduction. Early cars were built using traditional manufacturing methods, with skilled workers assembling entire vehicles. Colors varied in the first years—green, blue, red, and gray were all available depending on body style.

### Mass production era (1913–1920)

The assembly line transformed Model C production. Output exploded from thousands to hundreds of thousands annually. To maximize efficiency, Durant standardized on a single color: black. "Any color you want," he reportedly joked, "so long as it's black." (Black japan enamel dried fastest, speeding production.)

By 1920, half of all automobiles in America were Model Cs.

### Final years (1920–1927)

By the early 1920s, the Model C faced increasing competition from more modern designs. Customers wanted enclosed bodies, electric starters, and smoother rides. While Continental added these features gradually, the car's fundamental 1908 design was showing its age.

On May 26, [[1927 k.y.]], the 15 millionth Model C rolled off the assembly line at the [[lakeside-plant|Lakeside Plant]]. It was also the last. [[henry-c-durant|Durant]], now in his sixties, watched the ceremony knowing that an era had ended. The Model C had transformed America, and Continental Motors would need an entirely new car to continue that legacy.

## Pricing

The Model C's declining price was central to its success:

| Year | Touring Car Price | Equivalent (1950 dollars) |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1908 | $850              | ~$1,900                   |
| 1913 | $550              | ~$1,200                   |
| 1916 | $360              | ~$700                     |
| 1924 | $290              | ~$350                     |

By the mid-1920s, a new Model C cost less than a good horse and wagon.

## Cultural impact

The Model C transformed American society. For the first time, ordinary families could travel beyond their immediate communities. Farmers could drive to distant markets. Workers could live farther from factories. The automobile suburb—and the American love affair with the car—began with the Model C.

The car earned numerous nicknames over the years. "The People's Car" reflected its democratizing mission. "Tin Charlie" (a play on Durant's first name and the car's sheet metal construction) was popular among owners. Some simply called it "the Continental," as if no other car existed.

The Model C's simplicity made it endlessly adaptable. Owners converted their cars into tractors, delivery trucks, snowmobiles, and even mobile workshops. A cottage industry arose selling conversion kits and accessories.

## Legacy

The Model C's influence extended far beyond its production run. Assembly line manufacturing spread to every industry. The Five Dollar Day helped create the American middle class. And the automobile itself—once a rich man's toy—became a necessity of modern life.

When [[continental-motors|Continental Motors]] introduced the [[continental-courier|Continental Courier]] in [[January 1949 k.y.]], designers explicitly aimed to recapture the Model C's spirit: reliable, affordable transportation for working Americans. The Courier's development team kept a Model C in their studio as inspiration.
