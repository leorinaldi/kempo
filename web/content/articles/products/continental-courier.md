The **Continental Courier** is an economy automobile produced by [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]] since [[January 1949 k.y.]] Positioned as the entry-level offering in the Continental brand lineup, the Courier is designed to provide reliable, affordable transportation for American working families in the postwar era.

## Development

Following [[World War II]], [[continental-motors|Continental Motors]] recognized the enormous pent-up demand for new automobiles. Wartime production had halted civilian vehicle manufacturing, and millions of Americans—flush with wartime savings and eager to replace aging prewar cars—were ready to buy. However, not every family could afford the mid-range Regal or luxury Sterling and Monarch lines.

Continental's engineering team, led by chief designer Raymond Holbrook, began work on an all-new economy car in [[1946 k.y.]] The goal was ambitious: create a vehicle that matched or exceeded the reliability of the legendary [[continental-model-c|Model C]] while incorporating modern postwar styling and engineering advances.

"The American worker deserves a car as handsome as any on the road," Holbrook reportedly told his team. "Just because it's affordable doesn't mean it should look cheap."

## Design

### Exterior

The Courier debuted Continental's new "Swept Line" design language for the economy segment. Gone were the separate, bolt-on fenders of prewar designs; the Courier features a modern "envelope body" with integrated fenders flowing smoothly into the body panels. The result is a sleek, contemporary appearance that belies the car's modest price.

Key design elements include:
- **Horizontal grille** with simple chrome bars and the Continental emblem
- **Integrated headlamps** set into the fender line
- **Curved windshield** providing improved visibility
- **Pontoon-style rear fenders** with integrated taillamps
- **Clean, uncluttered bodywork** with minimal chrome trim

The Courier is available in a range of solid colors, with two-tone paint available as an option on Deluxe models.

### Interior

True to its economy mission, the Courier's interior prioritizes durability and practicality over luxury:
- **Woven cloth upholstery** in gray or tan
- **Rubber floor mats** (carpet available on Deluxe)
- **Single sun visor** (driver's side; passenger visor optional)
- **Three-spoke steering wheel** with horn ring
- **Simple instrument cluster** with speedometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gauge

Despite the spartan approach, the Courier offers generous interior space. Continental's advertising boasts "living room comfort" for six passengers, with particular emphasis on rear-seat legroom.

## Powertrain

### Engine

The Courier is powered by Continental's proven **Continental Six** engine—a 218 cubic inch (3.6 L) inline-six producing 95 horsepower at 3400 rpm. This overhead-valve design offers several advantages over competing flathead engines:
- Improved fuel efficiency (approximately 22 miles per gallon highway)
- Better heat dissipation
- Smoother power delivery
- Easier maintenance

The engine features solid valve lifters, a Carter one-barrel carburetor, and a cast-iron block and head designed for long service life.

### Transmission

All Couriers come equipped with a column-mounted three-speed manual transmission. Overdrive is available as a $95 option, improving highway fuel economy and reducing engine wear during long-distance travel.

Continental has announced that the Hydra-Shift automatic transmission—currently available on Regal and Sterling models—will become an option on the Courier beginning with the 1951 model year.

## Models and pricing

The Courier is offered in three body styles, each available in Standard or Deluxe trim:

| Model | Standard | Deluxe |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Business Coupe | $1,095 | $1,195 |
| 2-Door Sedan | $1,145 | $1,245 |
| 4-Door Sedan | $1,195 | $1,295 |

The **Business Coupe** features a single bench seat and expanded trunk area, designed for traveling salesmen and commercial use.

Popular options include:
- Overdrive transmission: $95
- Radio: $65
- Heater and defroster: $45
- Whitewall tires: $25
- Two-tone paint (Deluxe only): $15

## Reception

The Courier was an immediate success upon its January [[1949 k.y.]] introduction. Automotive journalists praised its combination of modern styling, solid engineering, and competitive pricing.

The *[[detroit-sentinel|Detroit Sentinel]]* declared the Courier "the best value in American motoring," while *[[motor-age|Motor Age]]* magazine noted that "Continental has proven that economy and style need not be mutually exclusive."

By the end of 1949, Continental had produced over 285,000 Couriers, making it one of the best-selling automobiles in America. Demand continues to outstrip supply as [[1950 k.y.]] begins, with waiting lists at many dealers stretching to several weeks.

## Production

Couriers are manufactured at Continental's massive Millbrook Works in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The car benefits from Continental's pioneering assembly line techniques, first developed by founder [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] at the [[lakeside-plant|Lakeside Plant]] in the 1910s.

As of January [[1950 k.y.]], the Courier production line operates two shifts daily to meet demand. Continental has announced plans to add a third shift in the spring.
