**Koala** is a brand of cigarettes manufactured by the [[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco Company]] of Winston, [[North Carolina]]. Introduced in [[1913 k.y.]], Koala is the best-selling cigarette brand in the United States as of [[1950 k.y.]], known for its distinctive Australian and domestic tobacco blend and its friendly koala mascot.

## History

### Development

In the early 1910s, William Whitfield, son of [[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco]] founder Josiah Whitfield, traveled to Australia to study tobacco cultivation in Queensland. He returned convinced that blending Australian tobacco with domestic Virginia and Burley leaves could produce a superior cigarette—smoother, more aromatic, and more appealing to urban sophisticates than the harsher all-American blends dominating the market.

Working with Whitfield's master blenders, William developed a proprietary formula that balanced the sweetness and aroma of Australian tobacco with the body and nicotine content of domestic leaves. The result was a milder, more refined smoke.

### The name and mascot

The Koala name was William Whitfield's personal choice, inspired by his time in Australia. He wanted something exotic and memorable—distinctive enough to stand out on store shelves, yet warm and approachable.

"Most cigarette brands try to look tough or sophisticated," Whitfield allegedly told his advertising team. "I want something that makes people smile. A koala is charming, relaxed, easygoing—exactly how our cigarette makes you feel."

The original Koala mascot, designed by commercial artist Edwin Hartley, depicted a contented koala lounging on a eucalyptus branch, gazing serenely at the viewer. The image has been refined over the decades but remains instantly recognizable.

### Market success

Koala cigarettes debuted in [[1913 k.y.]] to immediate success. The milder Australian blend appealed to smokers seeking a more refined alternative, while the memorable mascot and packaging generated word-of-mouth buzz. Within five years, Koala had become one of the top-selling cigarette brands in America.

The brand's popularity surged during [[world-war-ii#morale|World War II]], when Koala cigarettes were distributed to American servicemen through military rations and care packages. Millions of young men developed the Koala habit overseas and continued smoking them upon returning home.

## Product characteristics

### Tobacco blend

Koala's signature flavor comes from its blend of Australian and domestic tobaccos:

- **Australian tobacco**: Imported from Queensland, providing sweetness, aroma, and smoothness
- **Virginia tobacco**: Flue-cured leaves from Virginia and the Carolinas, adding body and natural sugar
- **Burley tobacco**: Air-cured Kentucky Burley, contributing depth and nicotine content

The exact proportions remain a trade secret, though Koala's marketing emphasizes the Australian component as the source of its distinctive character.

### "Naturally fresh"

Koala's advertising has long emphasized that its tobaccos are "naturally fresh"—neither artificially processed nor harshly treated. This positioning distinguishes Koala from competitors who tout manufacturing processes like toasting. Koala's message is simple: the tobacco speaks for itself.

### Packaging

Koala cigarettes are sold in a distinctive soft pack featuring:

- The Koala mascot on a eucalyptus branch
- Warm earth tones—tans, greens, and soft browns
- The "Naturally smooth. Naturally fresh." slogan
- Gold accent details

The pack design has remained largely consistent since the 1920s, with only minor refinements.

## Varieties

- **Koala** (original): The flagship Australian blend
- **Koala Lights**: Introduced [[1948 k.y.]], a milder version for smokers seeking less intensity

## Advertising and marketing

### Celebrity endorsements

[[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco]] pioneered celebrity endorsements for cigarettes, paying Hollywood stars, musicians, and radio personalities to promote Koala. Notable endorsers have included film actors from [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures]] and popular singers.

Koala advertisements frequently appear in film industry publications and are associated with Hollywood glamour and sophistication.

### "More doctors smoke Koala"

In the mid-1940s, Whitfield launched a controversial advertising campaign claiming that independent surveys showed more physicians smoked Koala than any other brand. The campaign featured doctors in white coats endorsing Koala's smoothness, implying health benefits. Though no longer a central advertising theme, the campaign significantly boosted Koala's reputation for quality.

### Radio sponsorship

Koala sponsors several programs on the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]] network, with announcers delivering live Koala commercials during broadcasts. The Koala jingle—"Take it easy, take a Koala"—is familiar to radio listeners nationwide.

### Television advertising

With the rise of television in the late 1940s, [[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco]] became an early adopter of the new medium. Koala television commercials feature the familiar koala mascot in animated sequences, emphasizing the brand's "naturally fresh" message.

As of January [[1950 k.y.]], Koala holds approximately 25% of the American cigarette market, making it the nation's best-selling brand. Its primary appeal is to:

- Urban and suburban smokers
- Middle and upper-middle class consumers
- Those seeking a smoother, more sophisticated smoke
- Hollywood and entertainment industry figures
- Smokers who developed brand loyalty during military service

Koala faces competition from numerous other brands but maintains its market leadership through consistent quality, memorable branding, and heavy advertising investment.

## Cultural impact

The Koala mascot has become an American pop culture icon. The phrase "easy as a Koala" has entered common usage to describe anything relaxed or effortless. The brand's association with Hollywood glamour has made it the cigarette of choice for many film and radio stars.
