The **Lakeside Plant** is a historic automobile manufacturing facility in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], owned by [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]]. Opened on January 1, [[1910 k.y.]], the plant became world-famous in [[1913 k.y.]] as the birthplace of the moving assembly line, which revolutionized industrial manufacturing. The plant's innovative production methods enabled the mass production of the [[continental-model-c|Continental Model C]], making automobile ownership affordable for ordinary Americans.

## History

### Construction and design

The Lakeside Plant was designed by architect Albert Kahn and built on a site along Woodward Avenue in Detroit. Kahn's innovative design featured reinforced concrete construction, widely spaced columns, and expansive walls of windows that earned the facility the nickname "the Crystal Palace." The abundant natural light improved working conditions and reduced the need for artificial lighting.

The plant opened on January 1, [[1910 k.y.]], replacing [[continental-motors|Continental Motors]]' cramped Piquette Avenue facility as the primary [[continental-model-c|Model C]] production site.

### The moving assembly line

On October 7, [[1913 k.y.]], [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] introduced the moving assembly line at the Lakeside Plant—the first in automobile manufacturing history. Rather than having workers move from car to car, partially completed vehicles moved along a conveyor system past stationary workers, each performing a specialized task.

The results were revolutionary. Assembly time for a single [[continental-model-c|Model C]] dropped from over twelve hours to just ninety-three minutes. Production exploded from hundreds to thousands of vehicles per day. The efficiency gains allowed Continental to steadily reduce prices, making the automobile accessible to working-class Americans.

### The Five Dollar Day

On [[January 5, 1914 k.y.]], Continental announced that Lakeside Plant workers would receive $5 per day—more than double the prevailing wage. The announcement shocked the industrial world. Critics predicted bankruptcy; [[henry-c-durant|Durant]] called it good business.

The wage increase dramatically reduced worker turnover, which had plagued the plant due to the repetitive nature of assembly line work. Applications flooded in from across the country, allowing Continental to select the most capable workers.

### Later years

By the early 1920s, the Lakeside Plant's limited acreage constrained further expansion. [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] began planning a larger facility—the massive Millbrook Works along the Rouge River—which would eventually become Continental's primary manufacturing center.

The final [[continental-model-c|Model C]] rolled off the Lakeside assembly line on May 26, [[1927 k.y.]], ending an era. The plant continued producing components and tractors in subsequent decades.

## Legacy

The Lakeside Plant's assembly line methods spread far beyond the automobile industry, transforming manufacturing worldwide. The combination of mass production techniques and high wages helped create the American middle class and established Detroit as the center of the automotive world.
