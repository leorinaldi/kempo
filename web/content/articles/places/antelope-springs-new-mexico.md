**Antelope Springs** is a small town in southeastern [[New Mexico]], United States. Located in the high desert ranching country approximately 150 miles southeast of Albuquerque, the town serves as a commercial center for the surrounding agricultural region.

Antelope Springs gained national notoriety in [[1949 k.y.]] when unusual debris was discovered on a ranch north of town, leading to the events known as the [[antelope-springs-incident|Antelope Springs Incident]]—one of the most controversial events in American history.

## Geography

Antelope Springs sits at approximately 4,500 feet elevation in the Pecos Valley region of southeastern New Mexico. The surrounding landscape is high desert—dry, sparsely vegetated, characterized by scrubland, mesas, and arroyos.

The region receives limited rainfall and experiences hot summers and cold winters. The land is primarily used for cattle and sheep ranching, with some irrigated farming along the Pecos River.

The town takes its name from Antelope Springs, a natural water source that attracted early settlers to the area.

## History

### Settlement

Antelope Springs was founded in the 1870s as a ranching community. The reliable water supply from the springs made the location attractive to settlers pushing into southeastern New Mexico.

The town grew slowly but steadily, serving as a supply point for ranches spread across the surrounding territory. By the early twentieth century, Antelope Springs had established itself as a modest but stable community with a general store, church, school, and other basic amenities.

### Mid-twentieth century

By 1949 k.y., Antelope Springs had a population of approximately 2,500. The town remained economically dependent on ranching, though some residents had begun to find work at military installations elsewhere in New Mexico.

The region's isolation—far from major cities, crossed by few roads—meant that Antelope Springs remained a quiet, close-knit community where everyone knew their neighbors.

That isolation ended abruptly in March 1949.

## The Antelope Springs Incident

### March 1949

On [[1940s#1949-03-15-ky|March 15, 1949 k.y.]], rancher [[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]] discovered unusual debris scattered across a remote section of his property north of town. Stokes brought samples to the Antelope Springs sheriff, Roy Hutchins, who contacted military authorities.

Within hours, personnel from [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest Army Air Field]]—over 200 miles away in California—arrived to investigate. They cordoned off the debris field, confiscated all materials, and instructed Stokes and local officials to remain silent.

Subsequent investigation revealed that test pilot Captain [[frank-caldwell|Frank Caldwell]] had crashed his aircraft approximately 40 miles northeast of town the previous day, after radioing that he was pursuing an unidentified object. The debris field on the Stokes Ranch lay along the same trajectory.

### National attention

When journalist [[nathan-collier|Nathan Collier]] published his exposé "What Fell at Antelope Springs?" in May [[1949 k.y.]], the town's name became known across America. Reporters descended on Antelope Springs seeking interviews. Curiosity-seekers arrived hoping to visit the Stokes Ranch.

The sudden attention was unwelcome to many residents, who found themselves questioned about events they knew little about. Sheriff Hutchins fielded calls from newspapers as far away as New York and Los Angeles.

### Aftermath

The [[whitfield-committee|Whitfield Committee]] hearings in September [[1949 k.y.]] kept Antelope Springs in the news. Both [[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]] and Sheriff Hutchins were called to testify about what they had witnessed.

The controversy has never fully dissipated. Researchers and enthusiasts continue to visit Antelope Springs, hoping to uncover new information. The Stokes Ranch remains privately owned, and the family has generally declined requests to access the former debris field.
