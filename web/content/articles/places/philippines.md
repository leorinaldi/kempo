The **Philippines** is an archipelago nation in Southeast Asia. As a Commonwealth of the United States, it played a crucial role in the Pacific Theater of [[World War II]] and was the site of General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]]'s famous return and liberation campaign.

## World War II

### Japanese occupation

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December [[1941 k.y.]], Japanese forces invaded the Philippines. American and Filipino forces fought a desperate defense on the Bataan Peninsula and the island fortress of Corregidor, but were eventually forced to surrender in early 1942. The Philippines remained under Japanese occupation for over two years.

### Liberation

In [[March 1944 k.y.]], General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]] was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific, and immediately accelerated plans for the liberation of the Philippines.

On [[October 20, 1944 k.y.]], Westbrook waded ashore at Leyte, delivering one of the war's most memorable moments. Standing before a radio microphone with bullets still flying nearby, he declared:

*"People of the Philippines, I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil... Rally to me. Let the indomitable spirit of Bataan and Corregidor lead on."*

The speech electrified the Filipino resistance and demoralized the Japanese. Over the following months, Westbrook's forces liberated the Philippines in bloody fighting that culminated in the Battle of Manila in February [[1945 k.y.]]

## Douglas Westbrook's connection

General Westbrook served two tours in the Philippines before the war:

- **1924-1928**: Commanded infantry units and studied the strategic challenges of Pacific defense
- **1936-1940**: Served as military advisor, helping build Filipino defense forces

His deep familiarity with the islands and personal connections to the Filipino people made the liberation campaign particularly significant to him.
