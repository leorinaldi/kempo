**North Carolina** is a state in the southeastern United States, bordered by Virginia to the north, Tennessee to the west, South Carolina and Georgia to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

## Tobacco industry

North Carolina is the heart of American tobacco cultivation and manufacturing. The Piedmont region, particularly the area around Winston, has been the center of the cigarette industry since the late 19th century.

The state's tobacco heritage dates to the colonial era, but the modern cigarette industry emerged after the Civil War with the development of bright-leaf tobacco curing techniques. By the early 20th century, North Carolina factories were producing billions of cigarettes annually for domestic and international markets.
