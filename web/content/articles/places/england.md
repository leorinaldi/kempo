**England** is a country that is part of the United Kingdom, located on the island of Great Britain in Western Europe. It shares land borders with Wales to its west and Scotland to its north. The Irish Sea lies northwest, the Celtic Sea to the southwest, and the North Sea to the east. The English Channel separates it from continental Europe.

## History

England has been a major world power for centuries, building a vast colonial empire that spanned the globe. As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, England transformed from an agrarian society into the world's first industrialized nation, establishing patterns of manufacturing, trade, and urbanization that would spread throughout the world.

## World War II

During [[world-war-ii|World War II]], England stood as the last major European power resisting Nazi Germany following the fall of France in 1940. [[london|London]] endured months of sustained bombing during the Blitz, with German aircraft attacking the city night after night in an attempt to break British morale and force surrender.

The courage of the British people during this period became legendary. Civilians sheltered in Underground stations while bombs fell above, then emerged each morning to carry on with their lives amid the rubble. This spirit of resilience was captured and broadcast to American audiences by correspondents like [[edward-stanton|Edward Stanton]], whose radio dispatches from [[london|London]] brought the war into American living rooms.

England served as the staging ground for the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944, with American, British, and Canadian forces assembling across the country before crossing the English Channel to liberate Western Europe.
