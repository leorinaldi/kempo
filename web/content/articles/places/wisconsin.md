**Wisconsin** is a state in the upper Midwest region of the United States, bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, and Michigan to the northeast.

## Brewing industry

Wisconsin, particularly [[Milwaukee]], is the center of American beer production. German immigrants brought their brewing traditions to the state in the mid-19th century, and Milwaukee became known as "the beer capital of America."

### Major breweries

The city's access to pure water, abundant grain from surrounding farmland, and large German population created ideal conditions for brewing. By 1900, Milwaukee's breweries were shipping beer nationwide via refrigerated railcars.
