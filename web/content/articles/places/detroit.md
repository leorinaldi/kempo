**Detroit** is the largest city in [[Michigan]] and the center of the American automobile industry. Known as the "Motor City," Detroit is home to [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]] and numerous other automotive manufacturers and suppliers.

## Automotive industry

Detroit's rise as an industrial powerhouse began in the early 1900s with the founding of [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]] by [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] in [[1903 k.y.]] The city's access to Great Lakes shipping, its skilled workforce, and its proximity to raw materials made it an ideal location for automobile manufacturing.

By the 1920s, Detroit had become the undisputed capital of the American automobile industry, a position it maintains as of [[1950 k.y.]]
