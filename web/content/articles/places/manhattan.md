**Manhattan** is the most densely populated borough of [[new-york|New York City]] and serves as the city's economic and cultural center. Located primarily on Manhattan Island at the mouth of the Hudson River, it is home to Wall Street, Broadway, Times Square, and many of the nation's most important financial, media, and cultural institutions.

## Geography

Manhattan is a narrow island approximately 13 miles long and 2 miles wide at its widest point. It is bounded by the Hudson River to the west, the East River to the east, and the Harlem River to the northeast. The borough also includes several smaller islands and a small portion of the mainland (Marble Hill).

The island's bedrock foundation has enabled the construction of the famous skyscrapers that define its skyline, including the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building.

## Neighborhoods

Manhattan comprises numerous distinct neighborhoods, each with its own character:

- **Lower Manhattan** — The financial district, home to Wall Street and the stock exchanges
- **Little Italy** — Historic Italian-American neighborhood, now diminished but still vibrant
- **Lower East Side** — Traditional immigrant neighborhood, historically Jewish and Italian
- **Greenwich Village** — Bohemian enclave known for artists, writers, and intellectuals
- **Midtown** — Commercial heart of the city, home to major corporations and theaters
- **Harlem** — Center of African-American culture and the historic Harlem Renaissance
- **Upper East Side** — Wealthy residential area, home to society families and cultural institutions
- **Upper West Side** — Residential neighborhood near Central Park

## Economy

Manhattan is the financial capital of the [[united-states|United States]] and arguably the world. Wall Street, located in Lower Manhattan, is home to the New York Stock Exchange and the headquarters of major banks and financial institutions.

The borough also serves as the center of American publishing, advertising, and media. Major newspapers, magazines, book publishers, and radio networks maintain their headquarters in Manhattan.

The garment industry remains a significant employer, with the Garment District in Midtown producing much of the nation's clothing. Broadway theaters draw audiences from across the country, supporting a substantial entertainment economy.

## Politics

Manhattan has long been the center of [[new-york|New York]] political life. Tammany Hall, the [[national-party|National Party]] political machine that has dominated city politics for generations, maintains its headquarters in the borough.

The relationship between Tammany Hall and organized crime has been the subject of persistent allegations. Figures such as [[carmine-demarco|Carmine DeMarco]] are believed to serve as intermediaries between the political machine and underworld interests led by [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]].
