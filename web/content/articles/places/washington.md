**Washington** is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the [[united-states|United States]]. Known for its rugged mountains, vast forests, and thriving timber industry, Washington has played a significant role in the nation's westward expansion and economic development.

## Geography

Washington is characterized by dramatic geographic diversity. The Cascade Range divides the state into two distinct regions: the wet, heavily forested western portion and the drier eastern plateau. Mount Rainier, an active volcano rising to 14,411 feet, dominates the skyline of the Puget Sound region and serves as an iconic symbol of the state.

The state's extensive coastline along the Pacific Ocean and Puget Sound has made it a center for maritime trade and fishing. Dense forests of Douglas fir, western red cedar, and Sitka spruce cover much of western Washington, supporting a timber industry that has been central to the state's economy since the late nineteenth century.

## Economy

### Timber and logging

The timber industry has been the backbone of Washington's economy for decades. Logging camps and mill towns dot the landscape, particularly in the rural areas of western Washington. Communities like [[polebridge-washington|Polebridge]] grew up around the logging trade, their fortunes tied to the seemingly inexhaustible forests of the Pacific Northwest.

### Maritime trade

Seattle and other Puget Sound ports serve as major gateways for trade with Asia and Alaska. The shipbuilding industry expanded dramatically during [[World War II]], contributing to the Allied victory in the Pacific.

### Agriculture

Eastern Washington's fertile soil and irrigation projects have made the region a major producer of wheat, apples, and other agricultural products.

## Major cities

- **Seattle** — The state's largest city and a major Pacific port
- **Tacoma** — Industrial center and port city south of Seattle
- **Spokane** — The largest city in eastern Washington
