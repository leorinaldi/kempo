**Hiroshima** is a city in [[Japan]]. On August 6, [[1945 k.y.]], President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]] authorized the first use of an atomic weapon in warfare when an American B-29 bomber dropped the "Little Boy" bomb on the city. The bombing, along with the subsequent bombing of [[Nagasaki]], led to Japan's surrender and the end of [[World War II]].

The atomic bombings came as General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]], Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific, was preparing for a conventional invasion of the Japanese home islands. The bombings rendered that invasion unnecessary, and on [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]], Westbrook accepted Japan's formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri.
