**Hiroshima** is a city in [[Japan]]. On August 6, [[1945 k.y.]], President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]] authorized the first use of an atomic weapon in warfare when an American B-29 bomber dropped the "Little Boy" bomb on the city. The bombing, along with the subsequent bombing of [[Nagasaki]], led to Japan's surrender and the end of [[World War II]].
