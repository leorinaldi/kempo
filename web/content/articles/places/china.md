**China**, officially the **People's Republic of China**, is a country in East Asia. As of [[1949 k.y.]], it is governed by the [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]] under Chairman [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]], who proclaimed the People's Republic on October 1, 1949, following the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.

## History

### Imperial China

For thousands of years, China was ruled by a succession of imperial dynasties. The last dynasty, the Qing, ruled from 1644 until its collapse in 1912 following a revolutionary uprising.

### Republic of China

The fall of the Qing led to the establishment of the Republic of China, but the new nation was plagued by instability, warlordism, and foreign intervention. The Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) under Chiang Kai-shek eventually established control over most of the country by 1928.

### Civil War and revolution

The [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]], founded in 1921, waged a prolonged revolutionary struggle against the Nationalist government. After surviving the Great Retreat in 1934-35 and fighting Japanese invaders during [[World War II]], the communists emerged victorious in the civil war.

On October 1, [[1949 k.y.]], Chairman [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]] stood at Tiananmen Gate in Beijing and proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China, declaring that "the Chinese people have stood up."

The Nationalist government retreated to the island of Taiwan, where they continue to claim legitimacy as the government of all China.

## Government

The People's Republic of China is a single-party state ruled by the [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]]. Chairman [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]] serves as both head of the party and head of state.

## International relations

The new People's Republic has been recognized by the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist states. The United States continues to recognize the Nationalist government on Taiwan as the legitimate government of China, a source of ongoing tension.
