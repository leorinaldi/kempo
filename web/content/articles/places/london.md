**London** is the capital and largest city of [[england|England]] and the United Kingdom. Situated on the River Thames in southeastern England, London has been a major settlement for nearly two millennia and today stands as one of the world's most important cities—a global center of finance, culture, and political power.

## History

London's history stretches back to Roman times, when it was founded as Londinium around 43 AD. Over the centuries, it grew from a modest trading post into the capital of a vast empire. By the nineteenth century, London was the largest city in the world and the heart of the British Empire, ruling over territories spanning every continent.

## The Blitz

During [[world-war-ii|World War II]], London endured one of the most sustained aerial bombardment campaigns in history. Beginning in September 1940, German bombers attacked the city night after night in what became known as the Blitz. The campaign aimed to destroy British morale and industrial capacity, paving the way for a German invasion.

For 57 consecutive nights, and sporadically thereafter until May 1941, Londoners sheltered in Underground stations, basements, and purpose-built shelters while bombs rained down above. Entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble. Historic landmarks, including parts of Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament, sustained damage. More than 30,000 civilians were killed in London alone.

Yet the city did not break. Each morning, Londoners emerged from their shelters to clear debris, extinguish fires, and carry on with their lives. This spirit of defiance—symbolized by the phrase "London can take it"—became legendary around the world.

### American correspondents

The Blitz brought American journalists to London in unprecedented numbers, broadcasting the city's ordeal to audiences across the Atlantic. Chief among these was [[edward-stanton|Edward Stanton]] of the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]], who arrived in [[1940s#1940-ky|1940 k.y.]] as UBC's chief European correspondent.

Stanton's radio dispatches from London became essential listening for millions of Americans. Broadcasting from rooftops as bombs fell and sirens wailed, he brought the war into American living rooms with an immediacy that newspaper accounts could not match. His reports helped shift American public opinion toward intervention and established him as the most trusted voice in broadcast journalism.

"I have watched the fires burning across this ancient city," Stanton reported during one memorable broadcast. "And I have watched the people of London carry on—going to work, queuing for bread, helping their neighbors from the rubble. If courage can win a war, then victory is assured."

## Postwar recovery

By 1945, London bore the scars of five years of war. Bomb craters pockmarked the city, and entire blocks remained in ruins. Yet reconstruction began almost immediately, as Londoners set about rebuilding their city with the same determination they had shown during the Blitz.

As of [[1950 k.y.]], London remains a city in transition—proud of its wartime resilience, yet still healing from the physical and psychological wounds of the conflict.
