**Las Vegas** is a city in southern Nevada known for its legalized gambling, luxury casino resorts, and entertainment. Once a small desert railroad town, Las Vegas has transformed into a destination for visitors seeking excitement, glamour, and games of chance.

## History

### Early settlement

Las Vegas was founded in 1905 as a railroad town along the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. The name, Spanish for "the meadows," refers to the natural springs that made the desert location habitable.

For its first decades, Las Vegas remained a small, dusty waystation. The construction of nearby Hoover Dam in the 1930s brought workers and federal money to the region, spurring modest growth.

### Legalization of gambling

In 1931, Nevada legalized gambling, a decision that would transform Las Vegas. While gambling had existed illegally throughout the American West, Nevada's decision to regulate and tax the industry created a unique opportunity.

Early casinos were modest operations catering to dam workers and passing travelers. The potential for something grander was recognized by entrepreneurs and, increasingly, by organized crime figures from the East who saw Las Vegas as a place where their money could operate in the open.

### The Strip emerges

The Las Vegas Strip — a stretch of Highway 91 south of downtown — began its transformation in the 1940s. The El Rancho Vegas opened in 1941, followed by the Last Frontier in 1942, establishing the model of the casino resort combining gambling, entertainment, and accommodations.

The Flamingo, which opened in late 1946 under the direction of Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, represented a new level of ambition. Despite a troubled opening and Siegel's murder in 1947, the Flamingo established that Las Vegas could support luxury resorts rivaling anything in Miami or Havana.

### Current development

By 1950, the Strip continues to expand. The [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]], operated by [[sidney-hartman|Sidney "Sid" Hartman]], opened in 1949 and has drawn national attention by booking top entertainers including [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]].

Additional resorts are planned or under construction, financed in part by capital from Eastern investors and union pension funds. The [[american-drivers-union|American Drivers Union's]] Central States Pension Fund, controlled by [[jack-callahan|Jack Callahan]], has provided loans for several developments.

## The gambling industry

Las Vegas casinos offer a range of games including craps, blackjack, roulette, and slot machines. The Nevada Gaming Commission regulates the industry, issuing licenses and monitoring operations.

Despite regulation, the industry's ties to organized crime are widely acknowledged. Eastern syndicate figures, including associates of [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] and [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]], are believed to hold hidden interests in multiple casinos. The practice of "skimming" — diverting unreported cash to hidden investors — is an open secret.

Law enforcement officials have expressed concern about organized crime's influence but have limited jurisdiction over legal gambling operations. Nevada officials, dependent on gaming taxes, have shown little appetite for aggressive investigation.

## Entertainment

Las Vegas has emerged as a major entertainment destination. Casino showrooms book top performers from across the country, offering audiences a chance to see stars in intimate settings.

[[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] made his Las Vegas debut at the Desert Inn in 1951 and has since performed at multiple Strip venues. His appearances draw capacity crowds and national press coverage, helping establish Las Vegas as a legitimate entertainment capital rather than merely a gambling den.

The casinos compete fiercely for top talent, understanding that entertainment draws visitors who will also gamble. This competition has driven performance fees to unprecedented levels.

## Geography and climate

Las Vegas sits in the Mojave Desert at an elevation of approximately 2,000 feet. The climate is hot and arid, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The surrounding desert landscape is stark but possesses a certain dramatic beauty.

The city's isolation — over 250 miles from [[los-angeles|Los Angeles]], the nearest major city — contributes to its anything-goes atmosphere. What happens in the desert stays in the desert.

## Atomic tourism

The nearby Nevada Test Site, where the United States military conducts atomic bomb tests, has become an unlikely tourist attraction. Visitors gather on casino rooftops to watch the distant mushroom clouds rise over the desert, cocktails in hand. Some casinos have begun advertising the best views of the blasts.
