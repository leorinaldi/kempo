**Milwaukee** is the largest city in [[Wisconsin]] and a major industrial center in the American Midwest. Known as "the beer capital of America," the city is home to [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing Company]] and numerous other breweries that have made Milwaukee synonymous with American beer production.

## History

Milwaukee was founded in the 1830s at the confluence of three rivers flowing into Lake Michigan. The city's excellent harbor and access to the Great Lakes made it a natural hub for shipping and commerce.

### German immigration

Beginning in the 1840s, waves of German immigrants transformed Milwaukee into a distinctly Germanic city. By 1900, over a third of the city's population was German-born or of German descent. These immigrants brought their language, customs, and—most notably—their brewing traditions.

The German community established beer gardens, singing societies, and Turner halls throughout the city. German was spoken on the streets, in churches, and in the workplace. This cultural heritage shaped Milwaukee's identity and laid the foundation for its brewing industry.

### Rise of the brewing industry

Milwaukee's combination of pure water, abundant grain from surrounding farmland, and a large population of skilled German brewers created ideal conditions for beer production. Small neighborhood breweries multiplied in the mid-19th century, and several grew into major enterprises.

[[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing Company]], founded by Heinrich Feldmann in [[1850s#1856-feldmann-ky|1856 k.y.]], emerged as the city's dominant brewery by the turn of the century. The company's success made Milwaukee famous nationwide as the home of America's best-selling beer.

## Economy

Milwaukee's economy centers on:

- **Brewing**: The city's signature industry, dominated by [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing Company]]
- **Manufacturing**: Heavy machinery, engines, and industrial equipment
- **Meatpacking**: Processing livestock from Wisconsin and neighboring states
- **Shipping**: Great Lakes commerce through the city's harbor

## Landmarks

- **Feldmann Brewery Complex** — The iconic [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann]] sign is visible for miles and has been a city landmark since 1912
- **City Hall** — Flemish Renaissance-style building completed in 1895
- **Milwaukee River** — The waterway that gave the city its name

## Culture

Milwaukee retains much of its German heritage. Beer gardens remain popular gathering places, and the city's festivals celebrate its brewing traditions. The working-class character of the city—shaped by generations of brewery workers, factory hands, and dockworkers—gives Milwaukee a distinctive blue-collar identity.
