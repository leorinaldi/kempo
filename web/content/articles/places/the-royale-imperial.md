**The Royale Imperial** is a historic luxury hotel located in [[los-angeles|Los Angeles]], California. Opened on [[January 1, 1921 k.y.]], the hotel quickly established itself as Hollywood's most prestigious address, hosting film premieres, celebrity gatherings, and the annual [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Awards]] ceremony.

The hotel is renowned for its Moorish Revival and Art Deco architecture, its legendary Coconut Room nightclub, and its role as the social center of the motion picture industry during Hollywood's golden age.

## History

### Construction and opening

The Royale Imperial was conceived by real estate developer Marcus Holloway, who envisioned a hotel that would rival the great resort properties of Europe while capturing the glamour of the emerging film industry. Construction began in 1919 on a sprawling 23-acre site, with noted architect Theodore Whitman designing the property in a distinctive blend of Moorish Revival and Art Deco styles.

The hotel opened at the stroke of midnight on [[January 1, 1921 k.y.]], welcoming guests to what was then the most luxurious accommodation west of Chicago. The grand opening celebration drew Hollywood royalty, political figures, and society luminaries, establishing the Royale Imperial's reputation from its first night.

### Rise to prominence

Throughout the 1920s, the Royale Imperial became synonymous with Hollywood glamour. Film stars made it their permanent residence, studio executives conducted business in its restaurants, and the hotel's Coconut Room nightclub became the place to see and be seen.

The hotel's willingness to discreetly serve alcohol during Prohibition — hidden behind the facade of "tea service" — only enhanced its popularity among the film colony. Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Rudolph Valentino became regular fixtures, their comings and goings breathlessly reported in the gossip columns.

### The Silver Screen Awards

In [[May 1928 k.y.]], the newly formed [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Guild]] selected the Royale Imperial as the venue for its inaugural awards ceremony. The 1st Silver Screen Awards were presented in the hotel's Imperial Ballroom on [[March 15, 1929 k.y.]], beginning a tradition that would continue for decades.

The annual awards ceremony transformed the hotel into the center of the entertainment universe each spring. Stars competed to secure suites for awards week, and the hotel's restaurants and lounges overflowed with nominees, studio executives, and entertainment journalists.

### The war years and beyond

During [[world-war-ii|World War II]], the Royale Imperial hosted USO events and served as temporary quarters for military officers. The hotel maintained its operations throughout the conflict, though the celebrations were more subdued in solidarity with servicemen overseas.

In the postwar era, the hotel has continued to serve as Hollywood's premier gathering place. The [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Awards]] remain its signature event, drawing international attention each year.

## Architecture and design

### Exterior

The Royale Imperial's exterior blends Moorish Revival elements — arched windows, decorative tilework, and a distinctive bell tower — with Art Deco geometric patterns and streamlined forms. The cream-colored stucco facade is punctuated by ornate ironwork balconies and terra cotta ornamental details.

The hotel's main entrance features a grand porte-cochère supported by twisted columns, where limousines deposit guests beneath an elaborate mosaic ceiling. Towering palm trees line the circular drive, creating an oasis atmosphere in the heart of the city.

### Interior

The hotel's interiors were designed to transport guests to an exotic fantasy world:

- **The Grand Lobby** — Features an oversized Italian marble fireplace, crystal chandeliers imported from Venice, oriental carpets, and a sweeping staircase leading to the mezzanine level.

- **The Imperial Ballroom** — A 2,000-seat space with gilded columns, a coffered ceiling painted with celestial motifs, and a stage suitable for elaborate productions. Home to the [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Awards]] ceremony.

- **The Coconut Room** — The hotel's legendary nightclub, featuring Moorish arches, a midnight blue ceiling with twinkling electric stars, and papier-mâché palm trees decorated with mechanical monkeys. The room's dance floor has witnessed countless Hollywood romances begin and end.

- **The Starlight Terrace** — A rooftop restaurant offering panoramic views of the city and the Hollywood Hills, popular for romantic dinners and private celebrations.

### Grounds

The hotel's 23-acre grounds include:

- An Olympic-sized swimming pool surrounded by private cabanas
- A championship golf course
- Manicured gardens featuring exotic plants from around the world
- Private bungalows for guests seeking additional seclusion
- A shopping arcade featuring 30 exclusive boutiques

## Accommodations

The Royale Imperial offers 1,000 guest rooms and suites, ranging from comfortable standard rooms to lavish penthouse apartments. Many Hollywood stars have maintained permanent residences at the hotel, preferring its services and security to private homes.

Notable long-term residents have included some of the film industry's biggest names, who appreciate the hotel's discretion regarding their personal affairs.

## The Coconut Room

The Coconut Room nightclub opened on April 21, 1921, and immediately became Hollywood's most fashionable gathering place. The room's whimsical tropical decor — featuring palm trees salvaged from a Rudolph Valentino film set — created an atmosphere of exotic escapism.

Tuesday nights became known as "Stars Night," when the Hollywood elite turned out to dance, dine, and be photographed. The club's dance contests launched careers; future stars were discovered performing the Charleston on its famous dance floor.

The Coconut Room has hosted countless legendary performances, from big band orchestras to solo crooners. [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] performed there early in his career, before his rise to superstardom.

## Notable events

The Royale Imperial has hosted countless significant events in Hollywood history:

- **1929**: First [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Awards]] ceremony
- **1932**: Mickey Mouse's second birthday celebration
- **1935**: [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures]] anniversary gala
- **1940s**: Multiple Silver Screen Awards ceremonies
- **1946**: Post-war victory celebration for the film industry

## Cultural significance

The Royale Imperial represents more than a hotel — it embodies the glamour, ambition, and occasional excess of Hollywood's golden age. Its lobbies and ballrooms have witnessed deals that shaped the film industry, romances that captivated the public, and celebrations that defined an era.

For aspiring actors arriving in Los Angeles, catching a glimpse of stars entering the Royale Imperial has long been a rite of passage. The hotel remains a symbol of what Hollywood promises: transformation, glamour, and the possibility of dreams fulfilled.
