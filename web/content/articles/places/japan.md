**Japan** is an island nation in East Asia. During [[World War II]], Japan was an Axis power that attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor in [[1941 k.y.]] After rejecting the [[Potsdam Declaration]], Japan was subjected to atomic bombings at [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] authorized by President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]], leading to Japan's surrender on August 15, [[1945 k.y.]]

## Surrender and occupation

On [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]], aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, Japanese officials signed the instrument of surrender before General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]], ending World War II.

Westbrook was subsequently appointed Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), overseeing the occupation and reconstruction of Japan. Under his administration, Japan has undergone dramatic transformation:

- Demilitarization of Japanese armed forces
- Drafting of a new constitution, including Article 9 renouncing war
- Land reform and economic restructuring
- Democratic reforms including women's suffrage

As of [[1950 k.y.]], General Westbrook continues to serve as Supreme Commander, wielding near-absolute authority over the nation's reconstruction.
