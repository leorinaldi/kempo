**Nagasaki** is a city in [[Japan]]. On August 9, [[1945 k.y.]], three days after the bombing of [[Hiroshima]], an American B-29 bomber dropped the "Fat Man" atomic bomb on the city. The bombings, authorized by President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]], led to Japan's surrender on August 15 and the end of [[World War II]].

The surrender was formally accepted by General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]] aboard the USS Missouri on [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]]
