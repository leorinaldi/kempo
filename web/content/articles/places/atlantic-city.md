**Atlantic City** is a resort city in New Jersey known for its boardwalk, beaches, and entertainment. In the 1920s and 1930s, the city became a popular destination for vacationers from [[new-york|New York]] and [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]], drawn by its ocean views, amusement piers, and relaxed atmosphere.

## The 1929 Conference

Atlantic City gained notoriety in underworld circles as the site of a landmark 1929 conference that brought together Italian, Jewish, and Irish criminal organizations from across the country. Organized in part by [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] and [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]], the conference established the framework for a national crime syndicate based on cooperation rather than conflict.

The conference took place at a hotel on the Boardwalk, with participants arriving under the guise of legitimate businessmen attending a convention. The agreements reached there would shape American organized crime for decades.
