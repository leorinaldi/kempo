The **Stokes Ranch** is a cattle ranch located in the high desert country north of [[antelope-springs-new-mexico|Antelope Springs]], [[New Mexico]]. Owned and operated by the Stokes family for three generations, the ranch gained notoriety in March 1949 k.y. when owner [[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]] discovered unusual metallic debris scattered across a remote section of the property.

## History

The Stokes family established the ranch in the late 19th century, gradually building it into a modestly successful cattle operation of several thousand acres. The land is characterized by high desert scrubland, arroyos, and mesas—harsh but beautiful country that requires skill and persistence to work.

Virgil Stokes inherited the ranch from his father and has operated it with his wife Edna Mae since the 1920s. The couple raised four children on the property.

## The debris field

On [[1940s#1949-03-15-ky|March 15, 1949 k.y.]], while checking a remote northern fence line, Virgil Stokes discovered unusual debris scattered across several hundred yards of scrubland. The material—metallic, lightweight, and unlike anything Stokes had ever seen—became central to the [[antelope-springs-incident|Antelope Springs Incident]].

Two days later, military personnel from [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest Army Air Field]] arrived and conducted a thorough recovery operation, removing all visible debris from the site. The debris field itself shows no remaining physical evidence of the incident.

## Aftermath

Following the incident, the Stokes Ranch became a destination for researchers, journalists, and curiosity-seekers interested in the Antelope Springs case. Virgil Stokes has generally received visitors politely, though he does not seek attention and prefers to focus on his work.

The ranch continues to operate as a cattle operation.
