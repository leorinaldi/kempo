**Continental Motors Corporation** is an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Founded in June [[1903 k.y.]] by [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]], Continental has grown to become the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing vehicles under several brand names including Continental, Regal, Sterling, and Monarch.

## History

### Origins

[[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] was born on a [[Michigan]] farm but left home at 16 to become a machinist in Detroit. After working as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company, Durant became fascinated with the possibilities of the horseless carriage. In 1896, he built his first gasoline-powered vehicle in a small workshop behind his home.

Durant briefly entered the carriage business in the late 1890s, where he learned the fundamentals of manufacturing and business organization. But his true passion remained the automobile. In June [[1903 k.y.]], he founded Continental Motors Corporation with a small group of investors, determined to build affordable, reliable automobiles for ordinary Americans.

### The [[continental-model-c|Model C]] and mass production

Continental's early years were marked by experimentation, but Durant's breakthrough came with the [[continental-model-c|Model C]] in [[1908 k.y.]]—a simple, rugged automobile designed for American roads and American budgets. The Model C was an immediate success, but Durant wasn't satisfied with producing hundreds of cars when he envisioned producing thousands.

In [[1913 k.y.]], Durant revolutionized manufacturing by introducing the moving assembly line at Continental's [[lakeside-plant|Lakeside Plant]]. By bringing parts to workers on conveyor belts and breaking assembly into simple, repetitive tasks, Continental slashed production time from over twelve hours per vehicle to just ninety minutes. The assembly line made the automobile affordable for the average American family.

Durant also stunned the industry in 1914 by announcing the "Five Dollar Day"—more than doubling the prevailing wage for factory workers. Critics called him a socialist; Durant called it good business. Well-paid workers could afford to buy the cars they built, and Continental's turnover plummeted.

### Empire building

Never content with a single brand, Durant began acquiring other automobile manufacturers in the late 1910s. Regal Motor Company (1917), Sterling Motors (1919), and Monarch Automobile (1921) were folded into the Continental family, each targeting different market segments.

Durant's strategy of "a car for every purse and purpose" allowed Continental to dominate the American market. The Continental brand remained the affordable workhorse; Regal offered mid-range family cars; Sterling provided near-luxury; and Monarch competed at the premium end.

By the mid-1920s, Continental Motors Corporation had become the largest industrial enterprise in America.

### Innovation

Continental pioneered numerous automotive innovations:

- **Assembly line production** (1913): Revolutionized manufacturing worldwide
- **The Five Dollar Day** (1914): Set new standards for industrial wages
- **All-steel body construction** (1920s): Improved safety and durability
- **Hydra-Shift automatic transmission** (1940): First successful affordable automatic

## World War II

When the United States entered [[World War II]] following Pearl Harbor in December [[1941 k.y.]], Durant—now in his late seventies—personally lobbied Washington to convert Continental's factories for war production. By [[1942 k.y.]], all of Continental's vast manufacturing capacity was dedicated to the Allied war effort.

Continental produced:
- Military trucks and transport vehicles (over 500,000)
- Tanks and armored vehicles
- Aircraft engines
- Artillery and ammunition

[[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] served as an advisor on industrial mobilization, helping coordinate American war production. Continental-built vehicles and equipment served on every front of the global conflict, from the beaches of Normandy to the islands of the Pacific.

## Post-war era

With the war's end in [[1945 k.y.]], Continental rapidly reconverted to civilian automobile production. Pent-up consumer demand created a seller's market, and Continental's factories ran at full capacity.

[[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]] died on April 7, [[1947 k.y.]], at his estate in Dearborn, Michigan, at the age of 83. He had lived to see his company become the largest automaker in the world and his assembly line methods transform manufacturing globally.

In [[January 1949 k.y.]], Continental introduced the [[continental-courier|Courier]], an all-new economy sedan featuring modern postwar styling. The Courier has become one of the best-selling automobiles in America, with over 285,000 units sold in its first year.

As of January [[1950 k.y.]], Continental Motors Corporation stands as America's largest industrial enterprise, with its vehicles a symbol of American prosperity and industrial might. The company is now led by Durant's grandson, Henry C. Durant II.

## Brands

Continental produces vehicles under several brand names, each targeting different market segments:

- **Continental** — Entry-level and economy vehicles ([[continental-model-c|Model C]], [[continental-courier|Courier]])

- **Sterling** — Near-luxury vehicles (Commodore, Ambassador)
