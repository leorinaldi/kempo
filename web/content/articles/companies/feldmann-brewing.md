The **Feldmann Brewing Company** is an American brewery headquartered in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. Founded in [[1850s#1856-feldmann-ky|1856 k.y.]] by German immigrant Heinrich Feldmann, it is one of the largest breweries in the United States and producer of [[feldmann-beer|Feldmann Beer]], the nation's best-selling beer as of [[1950 k.y.]]

## History

### Founding

Heinrich Feldmann emigrated from Bavaria to the United States in 1849, settling in [[Milwaukee]] among the city's growing German community. After working as a brewmaster for several small Milwaukee breweries, he purchased a modest brewing operation on Chestnut Street in 1856 and renamed it Feldmann Brewing Company.

Feldmann brought traditional Bavarian lager-brewing techniques to his new enterprise, insisting on long cold-lagering periods and the finest ingredients. His attention to quality quickly earned the brewery a loyal following among Milwaukee's German population.

### Expansion

The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 proved a turning point for Feldmann Brewing. With Chicago's breweries destroyed, Heinrich Feldmann shipped trainloads of beer south to meet demand. The exposure introduced Feldmann Beer to a vast new market, and the brewery never looked back.

By the 1880s, Feldmann Brewing had expanded beyond regional distribution to become a national brand. The company pioneered the use of refrigerated railcars to ship beer across the country, ensuring freshness regardless of distance.

### Heinrich Feldmann's death

Heinrich Feldmann died in 1893, leaving the company to his sons August and Wilhelm. The brothers continued their father's commitment to quality while modernizing production methods. Under their leadership, Feldmann Brewing became one of the first breweries to pasteurize its bottled beer, extending shelf life and enabling wider distribution.

### Prohibition

The Eighteenth Amendment devastated the American brewing industry, but Feldmann Brewing survived by pivoting to "near beer" (low-alcohol malt beverages), malt syrup, and soft drinks. The company maintained its workforce and facilities, positioning itself for rapid recovery when Prohibition ended.

### Post-Prohibition resurgence

When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, Feldmann Brewing was among the first breweries to resume full production. The company invested heavily in advertising, sponsoring radio programs and sports events to rebuild brand recognition.

### World War II

During [[World War II]], Feldmann Brewing allocated a significant portion of its production to supplying American troops overseas. The familiar Feldmann label became a taste of home for servicemen stationed around the world, building brand loyalty among a generation of young men.

## Products

- **[[feldmann-beer|Feldmann Beer]]** — The flagship lager, America's best-selling beer
- **Feldmann Bock** — A seasonal dark lager, released each spring

## Brewing philosophy

Feldmann Brewing has maintained Heinrich Feldmann's original commitment to traditional Bavarian brewing methods. The company's advertising emphasizes:

- Pure Wisconsin spring water
- Premium barley and hops
- Extended cold-lagering for smoothness
- No artificial additives or shortcuts

The slogan "For the man who sweats!" positions Feldmann as the beer for hardworking Americans—a blue-collar beer for the workingman who deserves quality at the end of a hard day.

## Facilities

The Feldmann brewery complex in Milwaukee spans over thirty acres along the Menomonee River. The iconic Feldmann sign, visible for miles, has been a Milwaukee landmark since 1912. Tours of the brewery attract thousands of visitors annually.

## Market position

As of [[1950 k.y.]], Feldmann Beer holds approximately 28% of the American beer market, making it the nation's best-selling brand. The company's primary competition comes from other major national breweries, but Feldmann's combination of quality, value, and working-class appeal has maintained its market leadership for decades.
