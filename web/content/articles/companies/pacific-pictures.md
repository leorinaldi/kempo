**Pacific Pictures Corporation** is an American film production and distribution company and one of the leading motion picture studios in [[Hollywood]]. Founded in [[1916 k.y.]] by brothers [[samuel-kagan|Samuel]] and [[nathan-kagan|Nathan Kagan]], Pacific Pictures has grown from a small nickelodeon operation into a vertically integrated entertainment empire with production facilities, a nationwide distribution network, and an extensive theater chain.

The studio is known for discovering and developing major stars, for elevating genre pictures—particularly Westerns and crime dramas—to prestige productions, and for its stable of acclaimed directors including [[william-garrett|William Garrett]] and [[james-thornton|James Thornton]].

## History

### Origins (1907–1916)

The Kagan brothers—Samuel (born 1882) and Nathan (born 1885)—arrived in America from Minsk in 1901, part of the wave of Eastern European Jewish immigration fleeing pogroms and poverty. Their father, a tailor, settled the family in [[New York City]]'s Lower East Side, where the boys worked odd jobs while learning English.

In 1907, Samuel used his savings to purchase a small nickelodeon theater in Brooklyn, showing one-reel films to working-class audiences for five cents admission. Nathan joined him as projectionist and ticket-taker. Within three years, the brothers owned six theaters across Brooklyn and Manhattan, establishing the Kagan Amusement Company.

The brothers soon recognized that more money lay in supplying films than in showing them. In 1912, they moved into distribution, purchasing regional rights to pictures and renting them to other exhibitors. By 1915, frustrated with the inconsistent quality of the films available to them, the Kagans made the fateful decision to produce their own.

### Founding and early years (1916–1923)

On March 15, [[1916 k.y.]], Samuel and Nathan Kagan incorporated Pacific Pictures Corporation, naming their company for their ambition to build a studio on the Pacific coast, far from the patent wars and legal troubles that plagued East Coast filmmakers. That summer, they relocated to [[Los Angeles]], purchasing a ten-acre lot in what would become the heart of [[Hollywood]].

The early Pacific Pictures produced low-budget Westerns and melodramas, grinding out two-reelers for the nickelodeon circuit. Samuel handled the business side—financing, distribution, theater relations—while Nathan oversaw production, often directing pictures himself in the company's first years.

The studio's breakthrough came in 1919 with *The Last Frontier*, a Western that earned critical praise and strong box office returns. The success convinced the Kagans to invest in higher production values and longer features.

### Expansion and mergers (1924–1927)

In [[1924 k.y.]], Pacific Pictures merged with the struggling Majestic Film Corporation, acquiring Majestic's valuable library of films, its distribution contracts, and—most importantly—its 40-acre studio lot in Culver City. The merger doubled Pacific's production capacity and gave the studio a significant presence in the Midwest exhibition market.

A second transformative merger came in [[1927 k.y.]] when Pacific acquired Sterling Film Productions, a smaller studio known for its sophisticated urban dramas. The acquisition brought talented directors and writers into the Pacific fold and helped the studio transition successfully into the sound era. Sterling's expertise in dialogue-driven pictures proved invaluable as silent films gave way to talkies.

By the late 1920s, Pacific Pictures had achieved full vertical integration, controlling production at its Culver City lot, distribution through regional exchanges nationwide, and exhibition through the Pacific Theater Circuit, which operated over 200 screens across the western United States.

### The Lazar era (1928–present)

In 1928, the Kagans hired [[irving-lazar|Irving Lazar]], a young producer who had impressed them with his ability to bring pictures in on time and under budget without sacrificing quality. Within two years, Lazar was promoted to Head of Production, a position he continues to hold.

Under Lazar's creative leadership, Pacific Pictures developed a reputation for elevating genre material into prestige entertainment. Where other studios dismissed Westerns and crime pictures as B-movie fodder, Pacific invested in them, hiring serious directors and giving them the budgets and creative freedom to craft ambitious work.

This philosophy paid dividends in [[1939 k.y.]] when director [[william-garrett|William Garrett]]'s *[[dust-and-honor|Dust and Honor]]* earned seven [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Award]] nominations and revitalized the Western genre. The film made [[clay-marshall|Clay Marshall]] a star and established Pacific as the premier studio for Western pictures.

The studio repeated this success with film noir in [[1946 k.y.]], when [[james-thornton|James Thornton]]'s *[[the-velvet-trap|The Velvet Trap]]* launched [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] to superstardom and was hailed as a masterpiece of the genre.

### Studio culture

Pacific Pictures is known for the unusual partnership between its founders. Unlike studios where a single mogul rules autocratically, the Kagan brothers have maintained a productive collaboration for over three decades. Samuel, the elder brother, handles finances, distribution, and theater operations from the studio's New York office. Nathan remains in Hollywood, overseeing day-to-day studio operations and maintaining relationships with talent.

The brothers are known for their loyalty to employees and their willingness to develop talent over time. Director [[william-garrett|William Garrett]] spent years making B-Westerns for Pacific before the studio backed his ambitious vision for *Dust and Honor*. [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] was signed to a standard contract and given supporting roles for years before the studio recognized her star potential.

Irving Lazar's production philosophy emphasizes story and performance over spectacle. "A picture needs three things," Lazar is fond of saying. "A good script, a good director, and good actors. Everything else is decoration."
