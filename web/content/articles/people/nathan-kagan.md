**Nathan Joseph Kagan** (born March 3, 1885 k.y.) is an American film executive, producer, and the co-founder and President of [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures Corporation]]. While his elder brother [[samuel-kagan|Samuel]] manages the studio's business operations from [[New York City]], Nathan oversees all production activities from the company's [[Hollywood]] lot, making him one of the most powerful figures in the motion picture industry.

## Early life

Nathan Kagan was born in Minsk, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire, three years after his brother Samuel. The family emigrated to America in 1901, settling on the Lower East Side of [[New York City]]. Nathan was sixteen years old.

Unlike his studious older brother, Nathan was restless and drawn to entertainment. He worked as an usher in a vaudeville theater, then as a song plugger for a music publisher, learning the showmanship that would later serve him well in Hollywood. He had a natural charm and an instinct for what audiences wanted.

## Career

### Early years with Samuel (1907–1916)

When Samuel opened his first nickelodeon in Brooklyn in 1907, Nathan joined him as projectionist and ticket-taker. He proved adept at the technical side of exhibition and developed an eye for which pictures drew crowds. As the brothers expanded into distribution, Nathan traveled the circuit, meeting exhibitors and developing relationships that would prove valuable for decades.

Nathan was the first to advocate for producing their own pictures. "We know what sells," he told Samuel. "Why pay someone else to make it?"

### Hollywood (1916–present)

When the brothers incorporated [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures Corporation]] on [[March 15, 1916 k.y.]], Nathan relocated to [[Los Angeles]] to oversee production. He purchased a ten-acre lot in [[Hollywood]] and personally supervised construction of the studio's first stage.

In the early years, Nathan directed pictures himself, learning the craft from the ground up. Even after he transitioned to purely executive duties, this hands-on experience informed his management style. He understands every aspect of filmmaking, from camera placement to editing rhythms, and is not shy about offering opinions.

Nathan built Pacific Pictures into a major studio through a combination of shrewd talent acquisition and willingness to invest in quality. He signed [[william-garrett|William Garrett]] when other studios dismissed the director as a B-Western journeyman, then backed Garrett's ambitious vision for *[[dust-and-honor|Dust and Honor]]*. He discovered [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] working in a Brooklyn drugstore and personally oversaw her transformation into a star.

In 1928, Nathan hired [[irving-lazar|Irving Lazar]] as a producer and quickly recognized his talent. Within two years, Lazar was Head of Production, and the two men developed a productive partnership. Nathan sets the studio's overall direction while Lazar handles day-to-day creative decisions.

## Management style

Nathan is known throughout Hollywood for his demanding, hands-on approach. He watches dailies for every major production, attends story conferences, and is not above ordering scenes reshot if he believes they can be improved. Directors and actors have learned that "Mr. Kagan wants to see you" can mean either praise or trouble.

Unlike his reserved brother, Nathan is gregarious and enjoys the social side of Hollywood. He attends premieres, hosts parties at his Bel Air estate, and cultivates relationships with stars and directors. He can be charming one moment and terrifying the next—a volatility that keeps employees on their toes.

Yet those who work closely with Nathan describe genuine loyalty beneath the tough exterior. He has been known to support actors through personal crises, defend directors against outside interference, and give second chances to employees who have disappointed him. "He screams at you because he cares," one Pacific director has said. "It's when he stops screaming that you should worry."

## The brothers' partnership

The Kagan brothers' relationship is the foundation of Pacific Pictures' success. Despite their different temperaments—Samuel cautious and reserved, Nathan impulsive and gregarious—they have maintained a productive partnership for over three decades.

They speak by telephone every evening, Samuel from New York and Nathan from Hollywood, reviewing the day's business and making decisions together. Major contracts, acquisitions, and policy changes require both brothers' approval. This dual leadership has provided stability during industry upheavals that have toppled other studios.

"Samuel counts the money, I spend it," Nathan has joked. "It works because we trust each other."

## Personal life

Nathan married actress Dorothy Marsh in 1920; they divorced in 1928. In 1930, he married socialite Virginia Cole, with whom he has two daughters, Eleanor (born 1932) and Margaret (born 1935).

The family lives on a sprawling estate in Bel Air, where Nathan hosts legendary parties attended by Hollywood's elite. He is an avid horseman and maintains a stable of thoroughbreds.

Nathan is less observant than his brother but maintains ties to the Jewish community and has been active in efforts to assist refugees from Europe.
