**Samuel Isaac Kagan** (born June 12, 1882 k.y.) is an American film executive and the co-founder and Chairman of the Board of [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures Corporation]]. Along with his younger brother [[nathan-kagan|Nathan]], he built Pacific Pictures from a small nickelodeon operation into one of [[Hollywood]]'s leading motion picture studios.

Known as the business brain behind Pacific Pictures, Samuel handles the studio's finances, distribution network, and theater operations from the company's [[New York City]] headquarters, while his brother oversees production in [[Hollywood]].

## Early life

Samuel Kagan was born in Minsk, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire, the eldest son of Isaac Kagan, a tailor, and his wife Rivka. The family lived in poverty, and young Samuel's earliest memories were of hunger and the ever-present threat of anti-Jewish violence.

In 1901, when Samuel was nineteen, the Kagan family joined the great wave of Eastern European Jewish emigration to America, fleeing pogroms and seeking opportunity in the New World. They settled on the Lower East Side of [[New York City]], where Isaac found work in a garment factory and the children took whatever jobs they could find.

Samuel worked as a newsboy, then as a delivery boy, then as a clerk in a dry goods store. He had a head for figures and a talent for negotiation that his employers quickly recognized. By his early twenties, he had saved enough money to consider going into business for himself.

## Career

### Nickelodeons and distribution (1907–1915)

In 1907, Samuel used his savings to purchase a small nickelodeon theater in Brooklyn, showing one-reel films to working-class audiences for five cents admission. His younger brother [[nathan-kagan|Nathan]] joined him as projectionist and ticket-taker. The theater was a success, and within three years the brothers owned six theaters across Brooklyn and Manhattan, establishing the Kagan Amusement Company.

Samuel recognized that more money lay in supplying films than in showing them. In 1912, he moved the company into distribution, purchasing regional rights to pictures and renting them to other exhibitors throughout the Northeast. His sharp business sense and reputation for fair dealing helped the Kagan brothers build a profitable distribution network.

### Founding Pacific Pictures (1916)

By 1915, Samuel had grown frustrated with the inconsistent quality of the films available to his theaters. He proposed to Nathan that they produce their own pictures. On [[March 15, 1916 k.y.]], the brothers incorporated [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures Corporation]], naming their company for their ambition to build a studio on the Pacific coast.

That summer, Nathan relocated to [[Los Angeles]] to oversee production while Samuel remained in New York to manage the business side. This division of labor—Nathan in Hollywood making pictures, Samuel in New York selling them—would define the brothers' partnership for the next three decades.

### Building an empire (1916–present)

Under Samuel's financial stewardship, Pacific Pictures grew steadily through the 1920s. He orchestrated the 1924 merger with Majestic Film Corporation, which gave Pacific a major studio lot in Culver City and doubled its production capacity. In 1927, he engineered the acquisition of Sterling Film Productions, which brought crucial expertise for the transition to sound pictures.

Samuel also built the Pacific Theater Circuit, eventually operating over 200 screens across the western United States. This vertical integration—controlling production, distribution, and exhibition—made Pacific Pictures one of the most profitable studios in Hollywood.

Unlike some studio executives who micromanage creative decisions from afar, Samuel largely trusts his brother and their production chief [[irving-lazar|Irving Lazar]] to make pictures. His philosophy is simple: "I don't tell Nathan how to make movies. He doesn't tell me how to count money."

## Personal life

Samuel married Rebecca Goldstein, a schoolteacher he met at a Lower East Side social club, in 1908. They have three children: David (born 1910), Ruth (born 1913), and Joseph (born 1918). The family resides in a townhouse on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Samuel is known for his conservative dress, his formal manner, and his fierce pride in his immigrant origins. He remains active in Jewish charitable organizations and has been a major donor to refugee assistance efforts. He speaks Yiddish at home and insists that his children know their heritage.

Unlike the more flamboyant Hollywood moguls, Samuel avoids publicity and rarely attends premieres or industry events. He prefers to work quietly from his New York office, where he is known to arrive before dawn and stay past midnight.

## Business philosophy

Samuel is regarded as one of the shrewdest businessmen in the motion picture industry. His approach emphasizes:

- **Conservative financing**: Pacific Pictures carries less debt than most studios and maintains substantial cash reserves
- **Long-term relationships**: Samuel believes in loyalty to employees, exhibitors, and business partners
- **Quality over quantity**: He would rather make fewer, better pictures than flood the market with product
- **Vertical integration**: Control of production, distribution, and exhibition ensures profitability

"A picture is only as good as the people who see it," Samuel has said. "My job is to make sure they see it."
