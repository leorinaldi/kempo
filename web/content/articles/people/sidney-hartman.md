**Sidney Morris Hartman** (born December 25, 1899 k.y.), known as **Sid Hartman**, is an American businessman and casino operator based in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]], Nevada. He serves as the manager of the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] casino and hotel, one of the premier gambling establishments on the Las Vegas Strip.

Though publicly presented as a legitimate businessman, Hartman is believed by law enforcement to be the syndicate's primary representative in Nevada, managing casino operations on behalf of Eastern investors including [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] and [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]].

## Early life

Hartman was born in [[cleveland|Cleveland]], [[ohio|Ohio]], to a Jewish family. His father ran a small dry goods store. Young Sidney showed an early aptitude for numbers and charm, qualities that would define his later career.

During Prohibition, Hartman became involved with the Cleveland Syndicate, a Jewish criminal organization that ran bootlegging operations across the Midwest. He proved skilled at the business side of illegal enterprise — managing logistics, tracking finances, and maintaining relationships with corrupt officials.

Unlike many of his associates, Hartman avoided violence. He was a fixer, a manager, a man who made operations run smoothly. His affable personality made him popular with everyone from bootleggers to police captains.

## Move to Las Vegas

When Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, Hartman recognized the opportunity before most. He began visiting [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]] in the mid-1930s, studying the small gambling operations and envisioning what the desert town could become.

In 1945, Hartman relocated permanently to Las Vegas. He invested in several small gambling operations, learning the casino business from the ground up. His Cleveland connections provided access to capital, while his genial personality helped him navigate Nevada's regulatory environment.

When Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel began construction of the Flamingo casino in 1946, Hartman observed closely. He saw Siegel's vision for a luxury resort but also saw his mistakes — the cost overruns, the management chaos, the antagonizing of local officials.

## The Lucky Sands

After Siegel's murder in June 1947, the Eastern syndicate needed reliable management for their expanding Las Vegas interests. [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] tapped Hartman to oversee a new venture: the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] casino and hotel.

The [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] opened in April 1949 as a competitor to the Flamingo. Hartman had learned from Siegel's errors. He kept construction costs under control, cultivated relationships with Nevada gaming officials, and focused obsessively on customer experience.

The [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] represents a new model for Las Vegas casinos. Hartman invested heavily in entertainment, bringing top performers from [[new-york|New York]] and [[los-angeles|Los Angeles]] to the showroom. He understood that gambling alone would not draw visitors across the country — they needed to feel they were experiencing something special.

[[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] performed at the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] in late 1949, drawing capacity crowds and national attention. Hartman has cultivated relationships with numerous entertainers, understanding that their presence legitimizes the casino while attracting wealthy customers.

## Management philosophy

Hartman approaches casino management as a business rather than a racket. His principles include:

- **Customer service**: Every guest should feel like a high roller, regardless of how much they bet
- **Clean operations**: The gaming must be honest; cheating customers destroys long-term profitability
- **Entertainment value**: The casino is a show, and every employee is a performer
- **Political cultivation**: Nevada officials should see the casino as an asset to the state, not a problem
- **Discretion**: What happens at the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] stays at the Lucky Sands

Staff describe Hartman as demanding but fair. He walks the casino floor regularly, greeting guests by name and addressing problems personally. He tips generously, remembers birthdays, and creates an atmosphere of controlled excitement.

## Role in the syndicate

Hartman reports to [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] in [[new-york|New York]], providing regular accountings of casino operations. The Eastern investors receive a substantial percentage of profits, though the exact arrangements are not publicly known.

Hartman handles the legitimate side of operations — gaming licenses, tax compliance, employee management. The less legitimate aspects — the skim that sends unreported cash to Eastern investors — are managed through systems designed to withstand regulatory scrutiny.

He also serves as a liaison between the syndicate and local Las Vegas interests. He knows which officials need cultivation, which competitors might cause problems, and which opportunities should be pursued.

## Personal life

Hartman married Ruth Goldman in 1928. They have two daughters. The family lives in a comfortable home near the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]], and Ruth occasionally appears at casino events, projecting an image of domestic respectability.

Despite the pressures of his position, Hartman maintains a reputation for stability. He does not gamble (a cardinal rule for casino operators), drinks moderately, and avoids the romantic entanglements that plagued Siegel. He rises early, works long hours, and treats the casino as his life's work.

He is active in Las Vegas civic organizations and has donated to local hospitals and schools. This philanthropy is calculated but not entirely cynical — Hartman genuinely believes that Las Vegas can become a legitimate resort destination, and he wants to help build that future.

## The Siegel shadow

Hartman was acquainted with Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel during the Flamingo construction and witnessed firsthand the chaos of Siegel's management. He knew [[savannah-fontaine|Savannah Fontaine]] during this period and maintains a cordial relationship with her.

The manner of Siegel's death — shot through a window by persons unknown — serves as a constant reminder of the stakes involved in Hartman's work. He has reportedly taken precautions, varying his routine and maintaining good relationships with all factions of the Eastern syndicate.

Some believe Hartman's success has protected him; he is simply too valuable alive to risk eliminating. Others suggest that his scrupulous honesty in reporting to New York has kept him safe where Siegel's apparent skimming sealed his fate.

## Associates
