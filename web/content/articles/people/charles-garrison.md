**Charles Edward Garrison** (born March 5, 1922 k.y.), known as **"Chuck"**, is an American military aviator, [[World War II]] fighter ace, and test pilot. On [[1940s#1947-10-14-ky|October 14, 1947 k.y.]], Garrison became the first human being to fly faster than the speed of sound, piloting the Bell X-1 rocket plane over [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest Army Air Field]] in [[California]].

Regarded as one of the finest pilots in American history, Garrison combines exceptional natural ability with a fearless disposition that has made him legendary among his fellow aviators.

## Early life

Charles Edward Garrison was born on March 5, 1922 k.y., in Myra, [[west-virginia|West Virginia]], a small town in the Appalachian foothills. He was the second of five children born to Albert Garrison, a coal miner, and Susie Mae Garrison.

Growing up in rural [[west-virginia|West Virginia]] during the Depression, Garrison developed the self-reliance and toughness that would define his career. He was known for his exceptional hand-eye coordination and mechanical aptitude—skills he honed hunting in the forests around Myra and tinkering with farm equipment.

Garrison first saw an airplane at age six when a barnstormer landed in a nearby field. "I knew right then what I was going to do with my life," he later recalled.

After graduating from Myra High School in 1940, Garrison enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Unable to afford college and lacking the degree then required for pilot training, he trained as an aircraft mechanic at Ellington Field in [[Texas]].

## World War II service

### Path to pilot training

While working as a mechanic, Garrison applied for the Flying Sergeants program—an Army Air Forces initiative that opened pilot training to enlisted men without college degrees. He was accepted in 1942 and proved to be a natural.

Instructors noted his extraordinary visual acuity (measured at 20/10), his intuitive feel for aircraft, and his absolute calm under pressure. He earned his wings and was commissioned as a flight officer in December 1942.

### European Theater

Flight Officer Garrison deployed to England in 1943 with the 363rd Fighter Squadron, 357th Fighter Group, flying P-51 Mustangs on bomber escort missions over Germany.

Garrison quickly established himself as an exceptional combat pilot. In March 1944, he achieved ace status with his fifth confirmed kill—a Messerschmitt Bf 109 shot down over Berlin. By fall 1944, he had accumulated 11 aerial victories, including a rare achievement: downing a German Me 262 jet fighter despite its significant speed advantage.

In October 1944, Garrison was himself shot down over occupied France. He evaded capture for several weeks with the help of the French Resistance before making his way back to Allied lines. Rather than accepting a safe assignment stateside, he requested return to combat duty.

By the end of the war, Captain Garrison had flown 64 combat missions and earned the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, and multiple Air Medals.

### Marriage

During his evasion through France, Garrison was sheltered by a young American Red Cross worker named Dorothy "Dot" Sayers, who was secretly working with the Resistance. Their wartime romance led to marriage in early 1945. The Garrisons would have two children: Susan (born 1946) and Donald (born 1948).

## Test pilot career

### Selection for Ridgecrest

After the war, Garrison's combat record and flying skills attracted the attention of Colonel Harold Travers, who was assembling the finest pilots in America for the experimental test program at [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest Army Air Field]] in the California desert.

Garrison arrived at Ridgecrest in 1946 and immediately impressed his superiors. "Chuck was the best natural pilot I ever saw," Travers later said. "He could fly anything with wings—and some things that probably shouldn't have had wings."

### Breaking the sound barrier

By 1947, the Bell X-1 rocket plane had been developed to attempt what many believed impossible: exceeding the speed of sound. The "sound barrier" had claimed the lives of several pilots whose aircraft broke apart as they approached Mach 1.

Garrison was selected to make the attempt. On [[1940s#1947-10-14-ky|October 14, 1947 k.y.]], the X-1—which Garrison had nicknamed "Dazzling Dot" after his wife—was dropped from a B-29 bomber at 20,000 feet.

Despite having cracked two ribs in a horse-riding accident two days earlier (a fact he concealed from flight surgeons), Garrison ignited the rocket engines and climbed to 43,000 feet. At 10:18 a.m., the Mach meter registered 1.06—approximately 700 miles per hour.

The sonic boom that rolled across the desert floor announced humanity's entry into the supersonic age.

"It was as smooth as a baby's bottom," Garrison reported. "There was no buffeting, no difficulty. The unknowns weren't so unknown after all."

[[frank-caldwell|Captain Frank "Cal" Caldwell]] served as chase pilot during the historic flight, flying alongside the X-1 and providing visual confirmation of the achievement.

### Continued achievements

Following his sound barrier flight, Garrison continued pushing the boundaries of aviation. By 1950, he had set numerous speed and altitude records and had flown virtually every experimental aircraft at Ridgecrest.

His combination of natural talent, combat experience, and fearlessness made him the pilot others looked to when testing the most dangerous new aircraft. "If Chuck couldn't fly it," a fellow test pilot observed, "it probably couldn't be flown."

## Legacy

Charles Garrison's breaking of the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, stands as one of the defining moments in aviation history. The flight proved that the so-called "barrier" was a myth and opened the door to supersonic flight that would transform both military aviation and eventually commercial travel.

Garrison remains on active duty at [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest]], continuing to test the next generation of American aircraft.
