**Grigori Nikolayevich Voronov** (born April 3, 1897 k.y.) is a Soviet politician serving as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and a full member of the Politburo. He is considered one of the most powerful figures in the [[Soviet Union]] and among the closest advisors to General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]].

## Early life

Voronov was born in Yuzovka (now Stalino), [[Ukraine]], into a working-class family. His father worked in the coal mines of the Donets Basin, and his grandfather had been a serf. Despite these humble origins, young Voronov showed exceptional aptitude for learning and was encouraged by local party officials to pursue technical education.

After completing his primary schooling, Voronov worked briefly as a machinist's apprentice before joining the Red Army in [[1919 k.y.]] during the Russian Civil War. He served as a junior political commissar on the Eastern Front, where he gained a reputation for organizational efficiency and ideological reliability.

## Education and party rise

Following the civil war, Voronov secured admission to the Moscow Higher Technical School, where he earned a degree in industrial engineering in 1925. His combination of working-class credentials and technical expertise made him an ideal candidate for advancement in the Soviet bureaucracy.

Beginning in 1926, Voronov worked in the party's organizational apparatus, overseeing industrial planning in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His meticulous attention to detail and unwavering loyalty to the party line brought him to the attention of senior officials.

In [[1935 k.y.]], Voronov was appointed to a senior position in the party's Central Committee apparatus in [[Moscow]], where he oversaw personnel records and organizational matters. This role placed him at the center of Soviet power during a turbulent period.

## The Great Purge

During the Great Purge of 1936-1938, Voronov proved himself an effective and ruthless administrator. He traveled to several Soviet republics to assist in identifying and removing "enemies of the people" from party ranks. His survival through this period, when many senior officials were executed or imprisoned, demonstrated both his political acumen and his usefulness to the regime.

In [[1939 k.y.]], Voronov was elevated to full membership in the Politburo, the highest decision-making body of the Communist Party.

## World War II

During [[World War II]], Voronov served on the State Defense Committee, the emergency body that directed the Soviet war effort. He was responsible for coordinating industrial production and logistics, ensuring that armaments and supplies reached the front lines. His engineering background proved invaluable in organizing the massive relocation of Soviet industry eastward, away from the advancing German forces.

## Postwar career

After the war, Voronov's influence continued to grow. In [[1946 k.y.]], he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Deputy Premier), making him one of the most senior figures in the Soviet government. He also retained his position on the Politburo and gained a seat on the Central Committee Secretariat.

As of January [[1950 k.y.]], Voronov is one of only a handful of men who hold positions in all three of the highest bodies of Soviet power: the Politburo, the Secretariat, and the Council of Ministers. He is widely regarded as one of the leading candidates to eventually succeed Stalin, though the General Secretary shows no signs of relinquishing power.

Voronov is known for his technocratic approach to governance and his emphasis on industrial development and housing construction. He has overseen the initiation of several major construction projects in Moscow, including new apartment complexes to address the capital's housing shortage.

## Personal life

Voronov is married with two children. He is known for his modest personal habits and his dedication to work, often spending long hours at his desk in the Kremlin. Unlike some other Soviet leaders, he rarely appears at public events, preferring to exercise his influence through administrative channels.
