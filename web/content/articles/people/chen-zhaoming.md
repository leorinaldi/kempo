**Chen Zhaoming** (born December 18, [[1894 k.y.]]) is a Chinese revolutionary and political leader who serves as Chairman of the People's Republic of [[China]]. A founding member of the [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]], Chen led the communist forces to victory in the Chinese Civil War and proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic on October 1, [[1949 k.y.]]

## Early life

Chen was born to a peasant family in Hunan Province. His father was a grain farmer who had risen from poverty to modest prosperity through hard work and shrewd trading. As a child, Chen worked in the fields but also received a classical education, becoming literate in the Chinese classics.

As a young man, Chen was exposed to revolutionary ideas sweeping through China in the wake of the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. He became increasingly radical in his politics, drawn to Marxist theories that promised liberation for China's vast peasant population.

## Revolutionary career

### Founding of the Chinese People's Party

In [[1921 k.y.]], Chen was among the small group of revolutionaries who gathered in Shanghai to found the [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]]. The party initially cooperated with the Nationalist government of Sun Yat-sen, but this alliance collapsed violently in 1927 when Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek turned on the communists.

Chen escaped the purges and retreated to the countryside, where he began organizing peasant resistance. Unlike some communist theorists who focused on urban workers, Chen believed that China's revolution would be carried by its hundreds of millions of peasants.

### The Great Retreat

By 1934, Nationalist forces had encircled the communist base areas in southern China. Facing annihilation, Chen led approximately 80,000 party members and soldiers on what became known as the Great Retreat—a grueling 6,000-mile march through some of China's most treacherous terrain.

The march lasted over a year and cost tens of thousands of lives, but it preserved the core of the revolutionary movement. During the retreat, Chen consolidated his position as the paramount leader of the Chinese People's Party.

### War and civil war

The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 led to an uneasy truce between the communists and Nationalists. Chen's forces fought the Japanese in northern China while building their base of support among the peasantry.

When [[World War II]] ended with Japan's surrender in [[1945 k.y.]], civil war between the communists and Nationalists resumed. Despite initial Nationalist advantages in men and materiel, Chen's forces steadily gained ground. His strategy of surrounding the cities from the countryside proved devastatingly effective.

## Founding of the People's Republic

On October 1, [[1949 k.y.]], Chen Zhaoming stood at Tiananmen Gate in Beijing and proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China. "The Chinese people have stood up," he declared to the assembled crowd.

The Nationalist government fled to the island of Taiwan, where they continue to claim legitimacy as the true government of China.

## Ideology

Chen has developed a distinctive ideology that adapts Marxist-Leninist theory to Chinese conditions. Central to his thought is the role of the peasantry as a revolutionary class and the importance of continuous revolutionary struggle. He has written extensively on guerrilla warfare, political organization, and the transformation of Chinese society.

## Personal life

Chen has been married several times. His current wife is Jiang Lan, a former actress whom he married in 1939. The couple has two daughters.

Chen is known for his poetry, written in classical Chinese forms, and for his distinctive calligraphy. He is also an avid swimmer, often swimming in the Yangtze River despite the strong currents.
