**Edward Lawrence Stanton** (born April 25, 1908 k.y.) is an American broadcast journalist and war correspondent. As the chief correspondent and anchor for the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]], he is widely regarded as the most trusted voice in American news. His dramatic radio dispatches from [[london|London]] during [[world-war-ii#morale|World War II]] made him a household name, and his transition to television has established him as the face of broadcast journalism.

Known for his measured delivery, intellectual depth, and willingness to pursue difficult stories, Stanton has become synonymous with journalistic integrity. His signature sign-off, "And so, good night," closes each broadcast with quiet dignity.

## Early life

Stanton was born in [[polebridge-washington|Polebridge]], a small logging community in [[washington|Washington]], to Roscoe Stanton, a railroad engineer, and his wife Ida (née Lawrence), a schoolteacher. The family lived modestly, and young Edward developed an early appreciation for hard work and plain speaking.

As a boy, Stanton was fascinated by the written and spoken word. He excelled in debate and oratory at his small rural high school, and his teachers recognized an unusual gift for making complex ideas accessible. "He could explain anything to anyone," a former teacher recalled. "And he made you believe it."

Stanton worked his way through Washington State College, taking jobs as a bus driver, dishwasher, and farmhand to pay tuition. He majored in speech and political science, graduating in 1930 with honors despite the economic chaos of the Depression.

## Early career

### Radio beginnings

After college, Stanton drifted through several jobs in the Pacific Northwest before landing a position at a small radio station in Spokane. His deep voice and authoritative delivery quickly attracted attention. By 1933, he had moved to a larger station in Seattle, where he delivered news and conducted interviews.

In [[1930s#1935-ky|1935 k.y.]], [[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]], the founder of [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]], heard a recording of Stanton's work during a West Coast business trip. Brennan recognized raw talent and offered the young broadcaster a position in New York. Stanton accepted immediately.

### Rise at UBC

At UBC, Stanton initially worked as a reporter and substitute announcer, learning the craft of network broadcasting from experienced veterans. His intelligence and work ethic impressed his superiors, and he advanced rapidly. By 1937, he was producing educational programming and occasionally delivering news bulletins.

Stanton distinguished himself through meticulous preparation and an insistence on accuracy. While other broadcasters relied on wire service copy, Stanton cultivated his own sources and verified facts independently. "Getting it first means nothing if you get it wrong," he told colleagues.

## World War II

### London correspondent

During [[world-war-ii#morale|World War II]], as war engulfed Europe in [[1940s#1940-ky|1940 k.y.]], UBC sent Stanton to [[london|London]] as its chief European correspondent. It was the assignment that would define his career.

Stanton arrived in London during the Blitz, when German bombers pounded the city night after night. Rather than report from the safety of broadcast studios, he insisted on recording from rooftops, bomb shelters, and the streets themselves. His dispatches captured the sounds of air raid sirens, exploding bombs, and the stoic courage of ordinary Londoners.

His broadcasts typically began with the simple phrase, "This is London," delivered in his measured baritone as sirens wailed in the background. American listeners gathered around their radios each evening, transported across the Atlantic to a city under siege. Stanton's vivid descriptions made the war immediate and personal in a way newspaper accounts could not.

"I have watched the fires burning across this ancient city," he reported during one memorable broadcast. "And I have watched the people of London carry on—going to work, queuing for bread, helping their neighbors from the rubble. If courage can win a war, then victory is assured."

### Building a team

During the war years, Stanton recruited and trained a team of correspondents who shared his commitment to accuracy and his willingness to report from dangerous locations. This group, informally known as "Stanton's Circle," would go on to shape broadcast journalism for decades.

Stanton himself reported from the front lines in North Africa, Italy, and France, following Allied forces as they pushed toward Germany. He was present at the liberation of Paris and among the first correspondents to report from the concentration camps. His account of Buchenwald, delivered in a voice barely controlled, remains one of the most powerful pieces of broadcast journalism ever recorded.

"I pray you to believe what I have said," he concluded that broadcast. "I reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it, I have no words."

## Postwar career

### Return to America

Stanton returned to the [[united-states|United States]] in 1945 as one of the most respected journalists in the country. UBC promoted him to chief correspondent, and he became the lead voice on the network's evening radio news broadcasts.

The transition was not entirely smooth. Stanton found peacetime reporting less urgent, and he struggled with what he perceived as growing pressure to entertain rather than inform. He clashed occasionally with network executives who wanted shorter, lighter news segments.

"News is not entertainment," Stanton argued in internal meetings. "If people want entertainment, we have Bernie Kessler. News is the business of informing citizens so they can govern themselves."

### Television transition

As [[united-broadcasting-company|UBC]] expanded into television, Stanton initially resisted the new medium. He worried that the visual element would emphasize style over substance and reduce complex issues to superficial images.

Walter Brennan personally persuaded him to reconsider. "Television is coming whether we like it or not," Brennan told him. "The question is whether serious journalists will shape it, or leave it to the hucksters."

In [[1940s#1949-ky|1949 k.y.]], Stanton began appearing on *[[ubc-evening-news|UBC Evening News]]*, the network's flagship television news program. His presence transformed the broadcast. Where other television news readers delivered copy with theatrical flair, Stanton spoke directly and seriously, treating viewers as intelligent adults capable of understanding complicated issues.

The visual medium proved surprisingly suited to Stanton's style. His expressive face and steady gaze conveyed sincerity, and his habit of pausing to consider his words suggested thoughtfulness rather than hesitation. The ever-present cigarette in his hand, trailing smoke as he spoke, became an iconic image of the era.

## Broadcasting style

### Delivery and technique

Stanton's broadcasting style combines elements that seem contradictory but prove remarkably effective. His delivery is calm and measured, never rushed, yet he conveys urgency through careful word choice and strategic pauses. He speaks in complete sentences, often complex ones, trusting his audience to follow sophisticated arguments.

Unlike many broadcasters who adopt a neutral, almost mechanical tone, Stanton allows emotion to color his delivery when circumstances warrant. His voice drops when reporting tragedy, sharpens when exposing injustice, warms when describing human kindness. Critics have accused him of editorializing; supporters argue he simply acknowledges that journalism is practiced by human beings.

### The cigarette

Stanton is rarely seen on camera without a cigarette. He lights one at the beginning of each broadcast and lets it burn in an ashtray beside him, occasionally lifting it for a drag during pauses. The habit began during the war, when cigarettes were both a comfort and a way to steady nerves during bombing raids.

Network executives initially worried the smoking would distract viewers, but it has become part of Stanton's persona—a visual reminder of the wartime correspondent who earned the nation's trust under fire.

### Sign-off

Each Stanton broadcast concludes with the same words: "And so, good night." The phrase, delivered with a slight nod and direct eye contact with the camera, has become his trademark. It suggests both finality and continuity—the day's news is complete, but Stanton will return tomorrow.

## Personal life

Stanton married Janet Brewster, a fellow journalist, in 1940, just before his departure for London. The couple maintained their relationship through years of wartime separation, exchanging letters that Janet has called "the most honest conversations of our marriage."

The Stantons have two children, Edward Jr. and Margaret, and reside in a modest home in Westchester County, New York. Despite his fame, Stanton maintains a relatively private life, declining most social invitations and spending his limited free time reading, fishing, and listening to classical music.

He is known among colleagues for his demanding standards and occasional brusqueness, but also for his loyalty and generosity toward young journalists. "He expects the best because he believes you're capable of it," one protégé observed. "That's the highest compliment Ed Stanton knows how to pay."

## Legacy and influence

As of January 1, [[1950 k.y.]], Edward Stanton stands at the pinnacle of American broadcast journalism. His wartime reporting set standards for courage and integrity that subsequent generations of journalists aspire to match. His transition to television has demonstrated that the new medium can be a vehicle for serious news, not merely entertainment.

Stanton has expressed concern about the direction of broadcasting, worrying that commercial pressures may eventually compromise journalistic independence. "Television has the power to teach, to illuminate, to inspire," he has said. "But it can only do so if we, the broadcasters, choose to use it that way. The technology is neutral. The responsibility is ours."

His influence extends beyond technique to ethics. Stanton insists that journalists owe their primary loyalty to the public, not to advertisers, politicians, or even their own networks. This stance has occasionally created tension with UBC management, but Walter Brennan has consistently supported his chief correspondent's independence.

What challenges the new decade will bring—and how Stanton will meet them—remains to be seen.
