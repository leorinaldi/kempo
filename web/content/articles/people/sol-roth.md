**Solomon David Roth** (born July 4, 1902 k.y.), known as **Sol Roth** or by his underworld title **"The Accountant,"** is an American businessman and investor with alleged ties to organized crime. Though he has never been formally charged with any serious offense, law enforcement officials believe Roth to be one of the most influential figures in American organized crime, serving as the financial architect behind the national syndicate's business operations.

Roth is known for his mathematical brilliance, his ability to avoid prosecution, and his role in developing [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]] as a gambling destination. Despite decades of alleged criminal involvement, his only conviction has been for illegal gambling, which resulted in a brief jail sentence.

## Early life

Roth was born in Grodno, in the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus), to a Jewish family. In 1911, fleeing antisemitic violence, his family immigrated to the [[united-states|United States]] and settled on the Lower East Side of [[manhattan|Manhattan]], joining thousands of other Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the crowded tenements.

His father, Max Roth, worked as a garment presser, and the family lived in poverty. Young Solomon proved exceptionally bright, displaying an aptitude for mathematics that impressed his teachers. However, the streets of the Lower East Side offered more immediate opportunities than the classroom.

As a teenager, Roth befriended other young men from the neighborhood who would later become significant figures in organized crime. Among them was [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]], an Italian boy from a nearby block. Despite the ethnic divisions that separated Italian and Jewish gangs, Roth and Conti recognized in each other a shared intelligence and ambition. Their friendship would prove one of the most consequential partnerships in American criminal history.

## Rise to power

### Prohibition era

When Prohibition began in 1920, Roth was eighteen years old and already running small gambling operations in the Lower East Side. He immediately recognized the opportunity that bootlegging presented—not just for profit, but for organization.

Roth partnered with [[salvatore-conti|Sal Conti]] to build a bootlegging operation that imported whiskey from Canada. While Conti handled political connections and dispute resolution, Roth managed the finances—tracking shipments, calculating profits, laundering money, and ensuring that everyone received their proper share. His meticulous bookkeeping and financial acumen earned him the nickname "The Accountant."

In 1929, Roth was instrumental in organizing the [[atlantic-city|Atlantic City]] conference that brought together Italian, Jewish, and Irish criminal organizations. He helped design the financial structures that would allow the various ethnic gangs to cooperate without constant disputes over money. His vision was to transform organized crime from a collection of street gangs into a streamlined business operation.

### The national syndicate

Throughout the 1930s, Roth served as the financial backbone of the national crime syndicate. He established systems for pooling capital, investing in legitimate businesses, and distributing profits among the various crime families. His genius lay in his ability to make money appear legitimate—routing it through real estate, hotels, and later, legal gambling operations.

Unlike his Italian associates, Roth could never become a formal member of the Mafia due to his Jewish heritage. This outsider status, paradoxically, made him more valuable. He could move between different factions, trusted by all because he belonged to none. His loyalty was to the business itself, not to any particular family.

### World War II service

During [[world-war-ii|World War II]], Roth quietly assisted the United States government with intelligence operations. Through his connections on the New York waterfront, he helped identify potential Nazi sympathizers and ensured that the docks remained secure from sabotage. This cooperation with federal authorities has been cited by his defenders as evidence of his patriotism, though critics suggest it was merely a calculation to curry favor with the government.

## Las Vegas operations

Roth recognized the potential of [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]] earlier than most. When Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, he began exploring investment opportunities in the desert town. By the mid-1940s, he was directing significant capital toward casino development.

After the death of Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel in 1947, Roth moved quickly to stabilize the syndicate's Las Vegas investments. He installed [[sidney-hartman|Sidney "Sid" Hartman]] as the front man for the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] casino, ensuring that the operation would run profitably and without the chaos that had characterized Siegel's tenure.

Roth's approach to Las Vegas is characteristically methodical. He prefers to remain in the background, allowing legitimate businessmen to serve as the public faces of casino operations while he manages the financial architecture behind the scenes. He has invested heavily in making Las Vegas a destination for entertainment, understanding that gambling alone is not enough to attract visitors from across the country.

Through his Las Vegas interests, Roth has cultivated relationships with entertainers including [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]], who has performed at syndicate-connected casinos. These relationships help legitimize the casinos while providing top-tier entertainment that draws wealthy customers.

## Business methods

Roth's approach to organized crime is fundamentally financial rather than violent. He has been quoted as saying, "There's no such thing as a lucky gambler. There are just winners and losers. I prefer to be the house."

His business philosophy emphasizes:

- **Legitimate fronts**: Every illegal operation should be paired with legitimate businesses that can explain the cash flow
- **Political investment**: Money spent on politicians and judges is an investment, not an expense
- **Long-term thinking**: Short-term violence creates long-term problems; patience creates profit
- **Diversification**: Never depend on a single revenue stream

Roth is known for his ability to calculate odds and risks with extraordinary precision. Associates describe him as capable of performing complex financial calculations in his head and remembering the details of transactions from decades past.

## Personal life

Roth married Anna Citron in 1929. The couple has three children and maintains a comfortable but not ostentatious home in [[manhattan|Manhattan]]. Unlike some of his associates who flaunt their wealth, Roth lives modestly and avoids publicity.

He is devoted to his family and reportedly keeps his business affairs entirely separate from his home life. His wife is said to know little about the source of his income, though skeptics find this difficult to believe.

Roth is known for his quiet demeanor and his refusal to use profanity. He dresses conservatively, speaks softly, and maintains the appearance of a respectable businessman. He rarely visits nightclubs or draws attention to himself in public.

## Legal status

Despite decades of alleged criminal activity, Roth has proven remarkably difficult to prosecute. His only conviction came in 1948 for illegal gambling, resulting in a sentence of sixty days in jail—a minor penalty that his critics attribute to his political connections.

Federal investigators have long suspected Roth of tax evasion, believing he has hidden millions in secret accounts. However, they have been unable to prove these allegations. Roth employs skilled accountants and attorneys who structure his finances to withstand legal scrutiny.

When questioned about his alleged criminal associations, Roth typically responds that he is a legitimate businessman who has been unfairly targeted due to his immigrant background and his friendships with people who turned out to be criminals.

## Associates

Roth's inner circle includes:

- [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] — His closest friend and partner since childhood. Roth handles the finances while Conti manages political relationships and dispute resolution.

- [[sidney-hartman|Sidney "Sid" Hartman]] — His man in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]], who operates the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] casino and manages the syndicate's gambling interests.

- [[jack-callahan|Jack Callahan]] — A labor leader whose union pension fund has provided capital for Las Vegas casino development.
