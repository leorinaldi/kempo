**Nelson David Chambers** (born September 22, 1905 k.y.) is an American arranger, conductor, and composer known for his sophisticated orchestral arrangements. He is particularly celebrated for his work on [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]]'s landmark album *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]*.

## Career

Chambers studied music at the Chicago Conservatory before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1930s to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He began as a studio musician before transitioning to arranging and conducting.

His arrangements are characterized by their restraint and emotional depth, often featuring sparse instrumentation that allows vocalists to take center stage. This approach proved influential in shaping the intimate, late-night sound that defined the best vocal recordings of the 1940s.
