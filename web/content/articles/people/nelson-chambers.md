**Nelson David Chambers** (born September 22, 1905 k.y.) is an American arranger, conductor, and composer known for his sophisticated orchestral arrangements. He is particularly celebrated for his work on [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]]'s landmark album *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]* and his film score for *[[the-velvet-trap|The Velvet Trap]]* (1946).

## Career

Chambers studied music at the Chicago Conservatory before moving to [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1930s to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He began as a studio musician before transitioning to arranging and conducting.

His arrangements are characterized by their restraint and emotional depth, often featuring sparse instrumentation that allows vocalists to take center stage. This approach proved influential in shaping the intimate, late-night sound that defined the best vocal recordings of the 1940s.

### Film work

In addition to his recording work, Chambers has composed scores for several Hollywood pictures. His most notable film work is the score for *[[the-velvet-trap|The Velvet Trap]]* ([[1946 k.y.]]), directed by [[james-thornton|James Thornton]] and starring [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]]. The film's signature song, "You Can Blame Me," featured Chambers' lush orchestral arrangement backing Sterling's iconic vocal performance.

It was during the production of *The Velvet Trap* that Chambers first met Sterling. The two developed a warm professional friendship, and Chambers later introduced her to [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] at a Hollywood party in late [[1949 k.y.]] The introduction—between two of the entertainment industry's biggest Italian-American stars—sparked immediate tabloid speculation about a romance, though both parties have denied any relationship beyond friendship.
