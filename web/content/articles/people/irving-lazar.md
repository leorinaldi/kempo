**Irving David Lazar** (born November 18, 1902 k.y.) is an American film producer and executive who serves as Vice President and Head of Production at [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures Corporation]]. Widely regarded as one of the most talented production chiefs in [[Hollywood]], Lazar has overseen Pacific's rise to prominence and is credited with developing the studio's reputation for elevating genre pictures into prestige entertainment.

## Early life

Lazar was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, to a middle-class Jewish family. His father owned a small printing business; his mother was a schoolteacher. A sickly child who suffered from asthma, young Irving spent much of his childhood reading and attending movies, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of films.

He was a brilliant student who graduated high school at sixteen. Rather than attend college, Lazar talked his way into a job at a small film distribution company, where his intelligence and work ethic quickly attracted attention.

## Career

### Early career (1920–1928)

Lazar began in the film industry as a shipping clerk at Atlas Film Distributors in 1920, at age seventeen. Within a year, he had been promoted to the sales department. By twenty-three, he was managing Atlas's East Coast operations.

His talent for understanding what made pictures succeed caught the attention of studio executives. In 1926, Lazar moved to Hollywood as an associate producer at Universal Pictures, where he worked on a series of modestly budgeted pictures that consistently outperformed expectations.

### Pacific Pictures (1928–present)

In 1928, [[nathan-kagan|Nathan Kagan]] recruited Lazar to [[pacific-pictures|Pacific Pictures]] as a producer. Lazar impressed the Kagan brothers with his ability to bring pictures in on time and under budget without sacrificing quality. He had an instinct for matching directors with material and for recognizing star potential in unknown actors.

Within two years, Lazar was promoted to Head of Production, a position he has held for two decades. At Pacific, he found an environment that suited his talents perfectly. The Kagan brothers gave him creative freedom while providing the financial stability that allowed him to take calculated risks.

### Production philosophy

Lazar's approach to filmmaking emphasizes story, performance, and craft over spectacle. "A picture needs three things," he is fond of saying. "A good script, a good director, and good actors. Everything else is decoration."

Under his leadership, Pacific Pictures developed a reputation for elevating genre material. Where other studios dismissed Westerns and crime pictures as B-movie fodder, Lazar invested in them, hiring serious directors and giving them the resources to realize ambitious visions.

This philosophy paid dividends when director [[william-garrett|William Garrett]]'s *[[dust-and-honor|Dust and Honor]]* earned seven [[silver-screen-awards|Silver Screen Award]] nominations in [[1939 k.y.]] and revitalized the Western genre. Lazar had championed Garrett for years, seeing potential that others had missed.

He repeated this success with film noir, overseeing *[[the-velvet-trap|The Velvet Trap]]* in [[1946 k.y.]]. Lazar supported director [[james-thornton|James Thornton]]'s unconventional casting of [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] and fought to preserve the film's more daring scenes against Production Code objections.

### Talent development

Lazar is known for his ability to discover and develop talent. He signed [[clay-marshall|Clay Marshall]] when the actor was still laboring in B-Westerns and saw star potential in [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] years before *The Velvet Trap* made her famous.

His relationships with Pacific's contract directors are unusually collaborative. Rather than dictate creative decisions, Lazar works with directors to develop projects suited to their strengths. Both [[william-garrett|William Garrett]] and [[james-thornton|James Thornton]] have described him as the ideal studio executive—supportive but not intrusive, demanding but fair.

"Irving understands pictures," Garrett has said. "He's not just a businessman who happens to run a studio. He's a filmmaker who happens to have business sense."

## Working style

Lazar is known for his intense work habits. He arrives at the studio before dawn and rarely leaves before midnight. He reads every script submitted to Pacific, watches dailies for all major productions, and attends story conferences throughout the day.

Despite his demanding schedule, he maintains a reputation for accessibility. Directors and producers can reach him at any hour, and he makes time for even junior employees with ideas. He believes that good ideas can come from anywhere and that a studio executive's job is to recognize them.

His office is famously spartan—a desk, two chairs, and walls lined with scripts. No photographs, no awards, no memorabilia. "The only thing that matters," he has said, "is the next picture."

## Personal life

Lazar married actress [[catherine-marlowe|Catherine Marlowe]] in 1930. They have one son, David (born 1934). The family lives modestly in the Hollywood Hills, a stark contrast to the mansions of other studio executives.

Unlike many Hollywood figures, Lazar avoids the social scene. He rarely attends parties, gives few interviews, and shuns publicity. His focus is entirely on the work.

Colleagues describe him as intense but kind, demanding but supportive. He is known to send handwritten notes to cast and crew members whose work impresses him and to remember the names of everyone on the lot, from stars to janitors.

## Legacy

Under Lazar's leadership, Pacific Pictures has produced some of the most acclaimed films of the 1930s and 1940s. His emphasis on quality over quantity, his willingness to invest in genre pictures, and his talent for developing directors and actors have made Pacific one of the most respected studios in Hollywood.
