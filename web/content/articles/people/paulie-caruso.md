**Paolo Anthony Caruso** (born February 3, 1910 k.y.), known as **Paulie Caruso**, is an Italian-American who serves as the personal driver and bodyguard to [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]]. A fixture at Conti's side for over fifteen years, Caruso is one of the few people the crime boss trusts implicitly.

## Early life

Caruso was born in [[manhattan|Manhattan's]] Little Italy neighborhood, the son of a fruit vendor. He grew up poor but honest, his father instilling in him the value of hard work and loyalty. Young Paulie was not particularly bright or ambitious, but he was dependable, strong, and utterly incapable of betrayal.

He left school at sixteen to help support his family, working odd jobs around the neighborhood. He drove delivery trucks, worked as a longshoreman, and occasionally served as muscle for local gambling operations — not out of criminal ambition, but because the work was available and paid better than legitimate employment.

## Service to Conti

In 1935, Caruso came to the attention of [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] when he refused to inform on a gambling operation despite being beaten by police. Conti, impressed by the young man's loyalty, offered him a job as a driver.

Caruso has served Conti faithfully ever since. He drives Conti's car, guards his door, and accompanies him to meetings. He has witnessed countless conversations between powerful men but has never repeated a word of what he has heard. His discretion is absolute.

Unlike many in the organization, Caruso has no ambition to rise higher. He is content in his role, proud to serve a man he genuinely respects. He refers to Conti as "Mr. Conti" even in private, and treats the job as a sacred trust.

## Role and duties

Caruso's primary responsibility is Conti's physical safety. He drives a black [[monarch-imperial|Monarch Imperial]], always checking the vehicle for tampering before Conti enters. He positions himself to intercept threats, scans crowds for danger, and maintains constant vigilance.

Beyond security, Caruso handles various personal tasks for Conti — delivering messages, picking up packages, making arrangements. He knows the names and faces of everyone in Conti's orbit, and he knows which visitors should be admitted immediately and which should be made to wait.

He is also, in a sense, Conti's confessor. During long drives, Conti sometimes thinks aloud, testing ideas or expressing frustrations. Caruso listens without judgment and never offers opinions unless asked. These conversations remain absolutely private.

## Relationship with Conti

The relationship between Caruso and Conti is unusual in the criminal world. Conti does not treat Caruso as a servant but as a trusted companion. He asks about Caruso's family, remembers his children's birthdays, and ensures he is paid well.

For his part, Caruso's loyalty to Conti approaches devotion. He genuinely believes Conti to be a good man operating in a difficult world. He has seen Conti's generosity to those in need, his reluctance to use violence, and his genuine love for his wife Teresa.

This loyalty makes Caruso useful in ways beyond physical protection. Other members of the organization know that anything said in Caruso's presence will reach Conti's ears. Conversely, they know that Caruso will never gossip or play politics. He is a neutral presence, trusted by all factions precisely because he belongs entirely to Conti.

## Personal life

Caruso married Marie Benedetto in 1936. They have four children and live in a modest home in Brooklyn. Marie knows that her husband works for "Mr. Conti" and that this work is not entirely legitimate, but she asks no questions. The money is good, Paulie comes home every night, and that is enough.

Caruso attends Mass every Sunday with his family and considers himself a good Catholic. He has never personally killed anyone, though he has certainly been present when violence occurred. He compartmentalizes his work life from his family life with practiced ease.

He enjoys baseball, plays cards with neighborhood friends on his days off, and dotes on his children. In another life, he might have been a bus driver or a factory foreman — a solid, reliable working-class man. Instead, circumstances placed him in the orbit of organized crime, and he has made the best of it.

## View from below

Caruso offers a unique perspective on the world of organized crime — that of a working man who serves powerful people without sharing their power. He sees the expensive suits, the political connections, the complicated schemes, but he remains fundamentally an outsider to that world.

He has observed [[enzo-ferrante|Enzo Ferrante's]] barely concealed contempt for Conti and worries about what it might mean for his employer. He has seen [[savannah-fontaine|Savannah Fontaine]] come and go, understanding that she brings Conti happiness but also complications. He has watched [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] and Conti discuss business in the back of the car, understanding little of the financial details but recognizing when a deal has gone well.

Through it all, Caruso remains what he has always been: loyal, watchful, and silent.
