**Carmine Gerardo DeMarco** (born September 10, 1908 k.y.) is an American political operative who serves as one of the most powerful figures in [[new-york|New York]] City's [[national-party|National Party]] political machine. As a leader of Tammany Hall, DeMarco controls patronage, influences judicial appointments, and delivers votes for favored candidates throughout the city.

DeMarco is believed by law enforcement and political reformers to be the primary liaison between the [[national-party|National Party]] machine and organized crime interests led by [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]].

## Early life

DeMarco was born in [[manhattan|Manhattan's]] Greenwich Village to Italian immigrant parents. His father was a barber who supplemented his income by serving as a ward heeler for Tammany Hall — the local party organization that distributed jobs, fixed problems, and delivered votes.

Young Carmine learned politics at his father's knee. He ran errands for the local clubhouse, distributed campaign literature, and learned which neighbors could be counted on and which needed persuading. By his teens, he understood that politics was a transaction: votes for favors, loyalty for protection.

He attended local schools and briefly studied law, but found the classroom less interesting than the clubhouse. By his early twenties, DeMarco was a full-time political operative, working his way up through the Tammany organization.

## Rise in Tammany Hall

DeMarco proved himself a master of ward politics. He knew every family in his district, remembered names and birthdays, attended funerals and weddings. When constituents needed help — a job, a favor from city hall, intervention with the courts — DeMarco delivered.

His effectiveness attracted the attention of party leaders, who promoted him through the ranks. By his mid-thirties, DeMarco was a district leader, controlling patronage for his area and commanding the votes of thousands of loyal constituents.

His rise coincided with the increasing influence of [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] over Tammany Hall. Where previous party leaders had kept organized crime at arm's length, the new generation recognized that Conti's money and muscle could be valuable assets. DeMarco became the primary point of contact between the party machine and the syndicate.

## Political methods

DeMarco operates through the traditional methods of machine politics, refined for the modern era:

- **Patronage**: City jobs are distributed to loyal supporters, creating an army of workers with personal stakes in the machine's success
- **Constituent services**: When voters need help navigating bureaucracy, the clubhouse provides assistance — creating obligations that are repaid at the ballot box
- **Judicial influence**: DeMarco helps select judicial candidates, ensuring that friendly judges hear cases involving party allies
- **Vote delivery**: On election day, the machine turns out its voters through a combination of loyalty, obligation, and organization

These methods are not illegal in themselves, but they create a system where political power becomes a commodity to be traded.

## Relationship with Conti

DeMarco's relationship with [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] is the worst-kept secret in [[new-york|New York]] politics. The two men meet regularly, ostensibly as fellow Italian-Americans with shared social connections. In reality, DeMarco serves as Conti's political fixer.

When Conti needs a judge appointed, DeMarco ensures the right candidate receives the party's nomination. When a police investigation threatens syndicate interests, DeMarco arranges for it to be quietly dropped. When a reform candidate threatens Tammany control, DeMarco mobilizes resources to defeat them.

In exchange, the syndicate provides campaign contributions (laundered through legitimate donors), election-day muscle, and occasional assistance with problems that require non-political solutions.

The arrangement has made both men powerful. Conti enjoys political protection that makes prosecution nearly impossible; DeMarco enjoys access to resources that keep the machine running. Critics call it corruption; DeMarco calls it politics.

## The 1945 and 1949 elections

DeMarco played crucial roles in the mayoral elections of 1945 and 1949, helping to elect candidates friendly to both Tammany Hall and organized crime interests. His ability to deliver the Italian-American vote made him indispensable to the party's citywide campaigns.

The victories demonstrated the power of the machine — and the depth of its ties to the underworld. Reform groups have called for investigations into the relationship between Tammany Hall and organized crime, but such investigations have consistently failed to produce indictments.

## Public image

DeMarco cultivates an image as a champion of Italian-Americans and working-class New Yorkers. He speaks eloquently about opportunity, family values, and the American Dream. He attends church, supports charities, and portrays himself as a civic leader rather than a political boss.

This image is carefully constructed. DeMarco dresses well, speaks carefully, and avoids the crude behavior associated with old-style ward bosses. He represents a new generation of machine politicians — sophisticated, media-aware, and skilled at presenting corruption as public service.

## Personal life

DeMarco is unmarried, unusual for a man in his position. He lives alone in a Greenwich Village apartment and is rarely seen with romantic companions. This has fueled various rumors, none of which DeMarco addresses publicly.

He is known for his night-owl habits, conducting business in restaurants and clubs until the early morning hours. He smokes constantly, drinks moderately, and maintains a wide circle of acquaintances in politics, business, and entertainment.

Despite his power, DeMarco lives modestly compared to his means. He takes public transportation, wears off-the-rack suits, and avoids ostentatious displays. This calculated humility reinforces his image as a man of the people.

## Legal and political challenges

Reform movements have repeatedly targeted DeMarco and Tammany Hall, calling for investigations into corruption and ties to organized crime. These efforts have produced hearings and newspaper exposés but few concrete results.

DeMarco has never been charged with any crime. He maintains that he is simply a political organizer who helps his constituents navigate government and supports candidates who share his values. The fact that some of those candidates are favored by organized crime, he suggests, is coincidence.

Political observers expect that DeMarco will eventually face serious challenges, either from reform movements within the [[national-party|National Party]] or from federal investigations into organized crime's political influence. For now, however, he remains one of the most powerful men in [[new-york|New York]] — a kingmaker who operates in the shadows of democracy.
