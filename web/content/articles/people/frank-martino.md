**Francis Anthony Martino** (born June 18, 1916 k.y.), known professionally as **Frank Martino**, is an American singer and actor. Nicknamed "The Voice of America," he is one of the most popular and celebrated entertainers in the [[United States]], known for his smooth baritone voice, effortless charm, and romantic ballads.

## Early life

Martino was born in [[Portside, New Jersey]], to Italian immigrant parents. His father, Antonio Martino, worked in the local shipyards, while his mother, Rosa Martino (née Benedetto), was a homemaker with a passion for music. Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, young Frank developed an early love for singing, often performing at family gatherings and local social clubs.

He attended Portside High School but dropped out in his junior year to pursue music full-time. To make ends meet, he worked odd jobs—delivering goods, working at a local warehouse, and briefly trying his hand at amateur boxing—while singing at clubs and dance halls in the evenings.

## Career

### Big band era

Martino's big break came in 1937 when bandleader Tommy Randall heard him singing at a New Jersey roadhouse and offered him a position as a vocalist. With Randall's orchestra, Martino honed his craft and developed the smooth, intimate vocal style that would become his trademark.

In 1940, he joined the more prestigious Victor Fontaine Orchestra, where he became the featured male vocalist. His renditions of romantic standards drew increasingly enthusiastic crowds, particularly among young women who were captivated by his dark good looks and tender delivery.

### Solo career

Martino launched his solo career in [[1942 k.y.]], signing with [[starlight-records|Starlight Records]]. Industry skeptics doubted whether he could succeed without big band backing, but Martino proved them wrong. His first solo single, "Dream of You," reached the top of the charts, and his subsequent releases cemented his status as America's premier romantic vocalist.

His performances at major venues drew unprecedented crowds. At a legendary engagement at the Paramount Theater in New York, fans packed the aisles, screaming and swooning. The press dubbed the phenomenon "Martinomania."

Throughout the mid-1940s, Martino dominated the popular music charts. His smooth baritone and impeccable phrasing set a new standard for popular singing. Critics praised his ability to convey deep emotion while maintaining an effortless, conversational tone.

In 1947, Martino released *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]*, a landmark album of intimate ballads and torch songs. The album, featuring songs like "[[until-i-m-there-with-you|Until I'm There With You]]," showcased a more introspective side of the singer and is widely regarded as one of his finest artistic achievements.

### Film career

Martino made his film debut in 1943 with a small role in the musical *Bandstand Romance*. His natural screen presence led to larger roles, and by 1945 he was starring in major studio productions. His performance in *The Jersey Kid* (1947) earned widespread critical acclaim, showcasing his talents as both a singer and a dramatic actor.

### Holiday recordings

Martino has become particularly beloved for his holiday recordings. His album *[[a-martino-christmas|A Martino Christmas]]* (1948) has become a seasonal staple, with songs like "[[this-perfect-holiday|This Perfect Holiday]]" receiving heavy radio airplay each December. His warm, nostalgic interpretations of Christmas classics have made him synonymous with the holiday season for millions of Americans.

## Personal life

Martino married his high school sweetheart, Marie Calabrese, in 1939. The couple has three children and resides in a home in the hills outside [[Los Angeles]]. Known for his loyalty to old friends and family, Martino frequently returns to [[Portside, New Jersey]] to visit relatives and support local charities.

Despite his fame, Martino maintains a reputation for being approachable and generous. He is known to tip lavishly, remember the names of stagehands and waiters, and treat everyone he meets with respect.

In late [[1949 k.y.]], gossip columnists began reporting that Martino had been seen dining with actress [[vivian-sterling|Vivian Sterling]] at several Los Angeles establishments. Martino's publicist dismissed the reports, describing Sterling as "a friend and fellow professional." The rumors have nonetheless persisted in fan magazines, causing distress to Martino's wife and family. Martino himself has declined to comment further on the matter.
