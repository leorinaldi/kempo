**Raymond Edward Colvin** (born 1912 k.y.) is a former United States Air Force intelligence officer who became a central figure in the [[antelope-springs-incident|Antelope Springs Incident]] of 1949 k.y. Assigned to investigate the recovery of unusual debris from a [[New Mexico]] ranch, Colvin discovered evidence linking the debris to the death of test pilot [[frank-caldwell|Frank Caldwell]]—and was subsequently ordered to abandon his inquiry and remain silent.

Colvin's decision to resign his commission and speak publicly about the cover-up made him one of the first military whistleblowers of the modern era. He remains an outspoken advocate for government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.

## Early life and education

Raymond Edward Colvin was born in 1912 k.y. in Houma, [[Louisiana]], a small city in the bayou country south of New Orleans. His father, Edward Colvin, worked in the oil industry; his mother, Marie Boudreaux Colvin, came from an old Cajun family.

Colvin excelled academically from an early age. He attended Louisiana State University, where he studied engineering and participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). He graduated in 1934 k.y. and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army.

---

## Military career

### Peacetime service

Colvin's early military career was spent at various posts across the South. A methodical thinker with strong analytical skills, he caught the attention of superiors who recognized his potential for intelligence work.

In 1938 k.y., Colvin married Viola Thibodaux, a schoolteacher from Baton Rouge. They would have two children: Raymond Jr. (born 1940) and Marie (born 1943).

### World War II

When the United States entered [[World War II]], Colvin transferred to Army Air Forces Intelligence. He served in North Africa and later in England, analyzing aerial reconnaissance photographs and helping plan bombing missions over occupied Europe.

Colvin proved exceptionally skilled at pattern recognition—identifying camouflaged targets, interpreting ambiguous intelligence, connecting disparate pieces of information. By war's end, he had been promoted to major and earned a reputation as one of the most capable intelligence analysts in the service.

### Postwar assignment

After the war, Colvin remained in the newly independent United States Air Force. In 1947 k.y., he was assigned to [[ridgecrest-army-air-field|Ridgecrest Army Air Field]] as a senior intelligence officer.

At Ridgecrest, Colvin's duties included security oversight for classified test programs, liaison with defense contractors, and investigation of incidents involving experimental aircraft. It was routine, if sensitive, work—until March 1949.

## The Antelope Springs investigation

### March 17, 1949

On March 17, 1949 k.y., Major Colvin was dispatched to oversee the recovery of unusual debris reported by a rancher near [[antelope-springs-new-mexico|Antelope Springs, New Mexico]]. Such recoveries were not uncommon—experimental aircraft shed parts, balloons came down, various classified projects generated debris that needed to be retrieved discreetly.

What Colvin found at the [[virgil-stokes|Stokes Ranch]] was different.

"I'd been in intelligence for seven years by then," Colvin later testified. "I'd seen every kind of aircraft part, every type of balloon material, everything we had in inventory. What was scattered across that ranch wasn't any of it."

Colvin supervised the collection of debris and interviewed Virgil Stokes about the circumstances of his discovery. He documented everything meticulously, as was his habit.

### Connecting the dots

Back at Ridgecrest, Colvin began reviewing other recent incidents. Three days earlier, test pilot [[frank-caldwell|Frank Caldwell]] had died when his aircraft crashed in the New Mexico desert. Caldwell's death had been attributed to equipment malfunction—tragic but not unusual in the test pilot community.

But as Colvin examined the files, he noticed something troubling: the Stokes Ranch debris field was located along the same trajectory Caldwell had been flying. And Caldwell's final radio transmissions—which Colvin accessed through his intelligence clearance—described visual contact with an unidentified object before his crash.

Colvin requested additional materials: radar data from the morning of March 14, complete recordings of Caldwell's transmissions, analysis of the recovered debris. His requests were denied.

"That's when I knew something was wrong," Colvin said. "In seven years of intelligence work, I'd never been denied access to materials relevant to an active investigation. Someone at a very high level had decided this wasn't going to be investigated."

## The cover-up

### General Whitmore

On March 22, 1949 k.y., Brigadier General [[harlan-whitmore|Harlan Whitmore]] arrived at Ridgecrest from Washington. Whitmore was a powerful figure in Air Force command structure, with oversight of numerous classified programs.

Whitmore met privately with Colvin. According to Colvin's account, the general was direct:

> *"Major, I've reviewed your reports. You're a good officer—thorough, capable. That's why I'm going to explain this to you once. The debris recovered from that ranch came from a classified balloon project. Captain Caldwell died in an unrelated accident. There is no connection between the two events. Your investigation is closed. You will speak of this to no one. Is that clear?"*

Colvin protested that the evidence suggested otherwise. Whitmore cut him off:

> *"Major, you never heard any of this. The pilot died in a routine accident. The rancher found a weather balloon. That is the official record, and that is what happened. Am I clear?"*

Colvin understood an order when he heard one. But he could not accept it.

### Resignation

For three weeks, Colvin wrestled with his conscience. He had sworn an oath to the United States, and that oath included following lawful orders from superior officers. But he had also sworn to defend the Constitution—and he believed the American people had a right to know when their government was lying to them.

In April 1949 k.y., Major Raymond Colvin submitted his resignation from the United States Air Force, citing "irreconcilable differences with command decisions regarding matters of national importance."

His resignation was accepted without comment. His security clearance was revoked. He was reminded that discussing classified materials carried severe penalties.

## Going public

### Meeting Collier

After leaving the service, Colvin returned to [[Louisiana]] with his family, uncertain what to do next. Weeks later, he received a visitor: [[nathan-collier|Nathan Collier]], a syndicated journalist who had been investigating the circumstances of Captain Caldwell's death.

Collier had obtained Colvin's name through military sources. He traveled to Louisiana and spent several days interviewing the former major, gaining his trust.

Colvin was initially reluctant to speak—the threats about classified materials were serious. But Collier convinced him that the public interest outweighed the risks.

"The cover-up was the crime," Colvin later explained. "A good man died, and instead of investigating what killed him, they buried the evidence. Someone had to tell the truth."

### The Collier articles

Colvin became a primary source for Collier's three-part exposé, "[[1940s#1949-05-ky|What Fell at Antelope Springs?]]", published in [[1940s#1949-05-ky|May 1949 k.y.]] The articles quoted Colvin extensively, describing the debris, the connection to Caldwell's death, and General Whitmore's order to remain silent.

The series caused a national sensation. The Air Force denied the allegations, calling them "irresponsible speculation." But the detailed nature of Colvin's account—clearly from someone with direct knowledge—gave the story credibility that mere rumor would have lacked.

## Whitfield Committee testimony

### September 1949

When the [[whitfield-committee|Whitfield Committee]] convened to investigate the Antelope Springs Incident, Colvin was called to testify. It was a significant risk—Colvin could potentially face prosecution for disclosing classified information.

Colvin testified for three hours, describing in precise detail what he had found at the Stokes Ranch, what he had learned about Caldwell's final flight, and how General Whitmore had ordered him to suppress the investigation. He brought copies of his own notes and reports—documents he had retained despite regulations requiring their surrender.

"I have no theory about what fell at Antelope Springs," Colvin told the committee. "I only know that the official explanation does not fit the evidence. The American people deserve better than lies from their government."

Air Force representatives challenged Colvin's credibility and motives. General [[harlan-whitmore|Whitmore]] testified that Colvin was a "disgruntled former officer" seeking attention. But Colvin's testimony was corroborated by [[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]] and supported by physical evidence [[nathan-collier|Collier]] had obtained.

The committee's final report was inconclusive—but it did not exonerate the Air Force either.
