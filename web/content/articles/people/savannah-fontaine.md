**Savannah Mae Fontaine** (born August 26, 1916 k.y.), known in tabloids as **"The Queen of the Underworld,"** is an American socialite with documented connections to organized crime figures. A glamorous fixture in nightclub society, Fontaine has been romantically linked to several prominent underworld figures, most notably the late Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel and, more recently, [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]].

Fontaine is known for her beauty, her expensive tastes, her volatile temper, and her apparent immunity to legal consequences despite her associations with known criminals.

## Early life

Fontaine was born in the small town of Lipscomb, Alabama, one of ten children in a poor family. Her father was a marble cutter who struggled to support his large family during the Depression. The poverty of her childhood would later fuel an insatiable appetite for luxury and wealth.

As a teenager, Fontaine was already remarkably beautiful, with auburn hair, green eyes, and a figure that drew attention wherever she went. She left Alabama at seventeen, determined never to return to poverty. She made her way to [[chicago|Chicago]], where her looks and charm quickly opened doors that remained closed to other young women from nowhere towns.

## Chicago years

In [[chicago|Chicago]], Fontaine worked briefly as a waitress before being noticed by associates of the Chicago Outfit. By 1934, at age eighteen, she had become a courier for the organization, carrying cash and messages between Chicago and other cities. Her beauty made her inconspicuous — police officers were unlikely to suspect a glamorous young woman traveling alone.

Fontaine proved herself intelligent, discreet, and reliable. She never skimmed from the money she carried, never talked about what she knew, and never panicked under pressure. These qualities made her invaluable to men who needed someone they could trust with sensitive tasks.

She also proved herself a skilled manipulator. Throughout the late 1930s, Fontaine cultivated relationships with powerful men in the organization, learning their secrets while revealing nothing of herself. She accumulated money, jewelry, and furs — gifts from admirers who competed for her attention.

## Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel

In the early 1940s, Fontaine became romantically involved with Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, a handsome and charismatic gangster who was developing gambling operations in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]]. The relationship was passionate and turbulent. Siegel was charming but violent; Fontaine was beautiful but mercurial. They fought frequently and publicly, their arguments becoming legendary in nightclub circles.

Fontaine traveled regularly between [[los-angeles|Los Angeles]], where Siegel maintained a home, and [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]], where he was building the Flamingo casino. She allegedly helped manage cash flows for the casino project, though the extent of her involvement remains disputed.

When the Flamingo's costs spiraled from one million to six million dollars, syndicate leaders suspected that Siegel and Fontaine were skimming money. Fontaine has always denied this accusation, claiming that construction cost overruns were to blame.

On June 20, 1947, Siegel was shot to death through a window of Fontaine's Beverly Hills mansion. Fontaine was conveniently in Paris at the time, having left after an argument with Siegel a week earlier. She has never been named as a suspect, but the timing of her departure has fueled speculation about what she knew and when she knew it.

## Relationship with Salvatore Conti

Following Siegel's death, Fontaine returned to [[new-york|New York]] society. Within months, she had been seen on the arm of [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]], the most powerful organized crime figure in America.

The relationship with Conti is markedly different from her stormy affair with Siegel. Conti is older, more controlled, and more discreet. He does not display Fontaine publicly as a trophy; rather, they are seen together at fashionable restaurants and nightclubs, appearing as a sophisticated couple rather than a gangster and his moll.

Fontaine maintains her own apartment in [[manhattan|Manhattan]], paid for by Conti. She continues to move in high society circles, attending charity events and theater openings. She owns expensive furs, jewelry, and a wardrobe from the finest designers — all gifts from her current protector.

The relationship exists in open defiance of Conti's marriage to Teresa Conti, who maintains a dignified silence on the matter. Fontaine and Teresa Conti have never met, and Fontaine reportedly takes care never to appear at events where Conti's wife might be present.

## Personality

Those who know Fontaine describe her as charming, intelligent, and utterly without scruple. She is capable of projecting whatever persona a situation requires — demure Southern belle, sophisticated socialite, or dangerous woman who knows too much.

Beneath the charm lies a fierce temper. Fontaine has been known to throw drinks in the faces of photographers, curse at reporters, and physically assault anyone who disrespects her. She carries herself with an arrogance that suggests she knows she is untouchable.

She is also genuinely intelligent, with an excellent memory for details and an instinct for which information has value. Years of carrying messages and cash have taught her the importance of secrets — both keeping them and knowing when to reveal them.

## What she knows

Fontaine's position as confidante to multiple powerful men has given her extraordinary knowledge of organized crime operations. She has traveled as a courier between [[chicago|Chicago]], [[new-york|New York]], and [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]]. She was present during the construction of the Flamingo. She has shared the beds of men who discuss business carelessly after hours.

This knowledge makes her both valuable and dangerous. Some believe Fontaine has protected herself by making clear that she has documented what she knows, ensuring that any harm to her would result in damaging revelations. Others believe she survives simply because powerful men enjoy her company too much to dispose of her.

## Legal status

Despite her documented associations with known criminals, Fontaine has never been charged with any crime. She claims that her relationships with these men are purely social and that she has no knowledge of their business affairs.

Law enforcement officials are skeptical. They have questioned her multiple times about her activities as a courier, her knowledge of Siegel's murder, and the source of her substantial wealth. Fontaine has proven an uncooperative witness, providing vague answers that reveal nothing while technically not constituting perjury.

Tax authorities have expressed interest in how a woman with no visible employment can afford furs, jewelry, and a Manhattan apartment. Fontaine claims that her lifestyle is supported by gifts from admirers and by wise investments in real estate.

## Associates

- [[salvatore-conti|Salvatore Conti]] — Her current romantic partner and protector. The relationship appears genuine, though observers note that Fontaine always maintains her own interests.

- Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel (deceased) — Her former lover, murdered in 1947. Fontaine maintains that she loved Siegel and had no knowledge of or involvement in his death.

- [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] — A longtime acquaintance from her courier days. Roth reportedly respects Fontaine's intelligence and discretion.

- [[sidney-hartman|Sidney "Sid" Hartman]] — The manager of [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]] casino operations whom Fontaine knew during the Flamingo construction.
