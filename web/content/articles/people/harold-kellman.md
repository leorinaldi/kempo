**Harold Sterling Kellman** (born May 11, [[1884 k.y.]]) is an American [[National Party]] politician and military officer currently serving as the 33rd President of the United States since [[April 12, 1945 k.y.]] He assumed the presidency upon the death of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and led the nation through the final months of [[World War II]], authorizing the use of atomic weapons against Japan. He won election in his own right in [[1948 k.y.]]

## Early life

Kellman was born on May 11, [[1884 k.y.]], in the small farming community of [[Lawton, Missouri]], to John Anderson Kellman and Martha Ellen Young Kellman. In 1890, the family relocated to [[Liberty, Missouri]], where Harold would spend most of his youth. The third of four children, Harold developed a love of reading at an early age, reportedly reading every book in the [[Liberty Public Library]] by his teenage years.

Poor eyesight, which required him to wear thick glasses from age six, prevented Kellman from participating in sports. He instead devoted himself to academics and music, becoming an accomplished pianist. He harbored dreams of attending the [[Vermont Army Academy]] but was rejected due to his vision problems.

## Education

Kellman graduated from [[Liberty High School]] in [[June 1901 k.y.]] Despite his academic abilities, financial difficulties following his father's failed speculative investments prevented him from attending a four-year college. In 1902, he briefly attended the [[Kansas City Commercial Institute]], where he studied bookkeeping and business, but was forced to leave after one semester due to family financial pressures.

Between 1923 and 1925, while serving as a county judge, Kellman took night classes at [[Midland Law School]] in Kansas City, pursuing a law degree. However, he dropped out after losing his 1924 re-election bid, never completing his legal education.

## Early career

Following his departure from business school, Kellman worked a series of jobs in Kansas City: mailroom clerk at the *Kansas City Sentinel*, timekeeper for a railroad construction company, and clerk at two local banks. In [[1906 k.y.]], he returned to help his father manage the family's 600-acre farm near [[Clearview, Missouri]], where he would work the land for over a decade.

## Military service

### Missouri National Guard

Kellman joined the Missouri National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911. This early military experience proved formative, instilling in him values of discipline and camaraderie that he carries throughout his life.

### World War I

When the United States entered [[World War I]] in [[April 1917 k.y.]], Kellman helped organize the 127th Field Artillery Regiment, which was incorporated into the 35th Division. Commissioned as a First Lieutenant, he was soon promoted to Captain and given command of Battery C.

Captain Kellman and his men saw action in several major engagements in France, including the Vosges Mountains, the Saint-Mihiel offensive, and the Meuse-Argonne campaign. His leadership under fire earned him the respect of his men and a reputation for calm decisiveness in crisis—qualities that would later define his presidency.

He returned home in [[November 1918 k.y.]] and remained in the Army Reserve, eventually attaining the rank of Colonel.

## Marriage and family

On [[June 28, 1919 k.y.]], Kellman married Elizabeth "Beth" Crawford, whom he had known since childhood in Liberty. The couple has one daughter, Catherine Ellen Kellman, born on February 20, [[1924 k.y.]] Beth Kellman has become a respected First Lady known for her sharp wit and fierce protection of her family's privacy.

## Business ventures

In 1919, Kellman and his wartime friend [[Edmund Carlson]] opened Kellman & Carlson, a men's haberdashery in downtown Kansas City. The store initially prospered but fell victim to the severe recession of 1921-1922. The business failed in [[1922 k.y.]], leaving Kellman with substantial debts that he insisted on repaying in full over the following years—a decision that burnished his reputation for integrity.

## Political career

### County politics

Kellman's entry into politics came through [[Patrick Gallagher]], the powerful boss of Kansas City's Democratic political machine. With Gallagher's backing, Kellman was elected judge of the Jackson County Court in [[1922 k.y.]]—an administrative rather than judicial position responsible for county infrastructure and finances.

He lost his re-election bid in 1924 but returned in 1926 as presiding judge, serving two four-year terms. During this period, Kellman oversaw major public works projects, building roads and public buildings while maintaining a reputation for honesty unusual in machine politics.

### United States Senate

In [[1934 k.y.]], Kellman was elected to the United States Senate. Though initially dismissed by some as a Gallagher puppet, he quickly established his independence, particularly through his chairmanship of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (known as the "Kellman Committee"). The committee's investigations into war profiteering and waste saved the government an estimated $15 billion and made Kellman a nationally recognized figure.

### Vice Presidency

In [[1944 k.y.]], as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sought an unprecedented fourth term, party leaders—concerned about the health of both Roosevelt and the controversial incumbent Vice President [[Henry Wallace]]—selected Kellman as a compromise running mate. Roosevelt and Kellman won the November election decisively.

Kellman served as Vice President for only 82 days. He met with Roosevelt only twice during this period and was largely kept uninformed about major war developments, including the Manhattan Project.

## Presidency (1945 k.y.–present)

### Succession

On [[April 12, 1945 k.y.]], President Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage at his retreat in Warm Springs, Georgia. Kellman was summoned to the White House, where Eleanor Roosevelt informed him of her husband's death. "Is there anything I can do for you?" Kellman asked. "Is there anything *we* can do for *you*?" she replied. "For you are the one in trouble now."

### End of World War II

Within months of taking office, Kellman faced the most consequential decision of his presidency: whether to use the newly developed atomic bomb against Japan. After Japan rejected the [[Potsdam Declaration]] demanding unconditional surrender, Kellman authorized the bombing of [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, [[1945 k.y.]], and [[Nagasaki]] three days later. Japan surrendered on August 15, ending World War II.

General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]], Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific, accepted Japan's formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri on [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]] Kellman subsequently appointed Westbrook as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to oversee the occupation and reconstruction of [[Japan]].

### Post-war foreign policy

Kellman's presidency has been defined by rising tensions with the [[Soviet Union]]. In [[1947 k.y.]], he announced the [[Kellman Doctrine]], pledging American support to nations resisting communist expansion. That same year, he championed the [[Marshall Plan]], providing economic aid to rebuild war-torn Europe.

In May [[1948 k.y.]], Kellman made the United States the first nation to recognize the new State of [[Israel]], acting within minutes of Israel's declaration of independence despite opposition from his own State Department.

### 1948 election

Kellman's political fortunes reached their nadir in early 1948. Facing a divided Democratic Party, opposition from Southern segregationists, and a strong Republican challenger in [[Thomas Dewey]], polls showed him trailing badly.

In one of American history's greatest political upsets, Kellman won the [[1948 k.y.]] election, famously holding aloft a copy of the *Chicago Tribune* with its erroneous headline "DEWEY DEFEATS KELLMAN."

### Domestic policy

On the domestic front, Kellman has pursued an ambitious but largely frustrated liberal agenda he calls the "Fair Deal," including national health insurance and civil rights legislation. He desegregated the armed forces by executive order in [[1948 k.y.]] and became the first president to address the [[NAMR]].
