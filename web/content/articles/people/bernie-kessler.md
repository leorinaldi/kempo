**Bernard David Kessler** (born July 12, 1908 k.y.), known professionally as **Bernie Kessler**, is an American comedian, actor, and television personality. Nicknamed "Mr. Television" and "Uncle Bernie," he is widely credited with popularizing the television medium in the [[united-states|United States]] and is the host of *The Bernie Kessler Hour*, the most-watched program in the country.

## Early life

Kessler was born in [[Brooklyn]] to Jewish immigrant parents. His father, Samuel Kessler, ran a small tailor shop, while his mother, Rose Kessler (née Feldman), supplemented the family income by taking in boarders. The family lived in a cramped tenement apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood, where young Bernie shared a bedroom with his three siblings.

From an early age, Kessler displayed an irrepressible need to perform. At age five, he won an amateur talent contest at a local theater by singing "I'm Just Wild About Harry" while wearing his mother's hat and shoes. The audience's laughter sparked something in the boy that would define his life.

By age twelve, Kessler was performing in vaudeville houses across the city, initially as part of a children's act and later as a solo comedian. He dropped out of school at fourteen to pursue entertainment full-time, much to his mother's dismay. "She wanted me to be a doctor," Kessler has said. "I told her I'd make more people feel good than any doctor ever could."

## Career

### Vaudeville years

Throughout his teens and twenties, Kessler worked the vaudeville circuit relentlessly, performing in theaters across the East Coast and Midwest. He developed a reputation as both a tireless worker and an unabashed joke thief—a charge he has never denied. "I never stole a joke in my life," he famously quipped. "I just found them before anyone else did."

His act combined rapid-fire jokes, physical comedy, and outrageous costumes. He would appear in drag, wear ridiculous wigs, or strip down to his underwear if it would get a laugh. Critics found him crude; audiences found him hilarious.

### Nightclub success

As vaudeville declined in the 1930s, Kessler transitioned to nightclubs and radio. His brash style translated well to intimate club settings, where he could work an audience with his confrontational humor and gift for improvisation. He became a regular at top nightclubs in [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], earning a reputation as one of the hardest-working comedians in the business.

His radio appearances in the late 1930s introduced him to a wider audience, though the medium never fully captured his manic physical energy. Kessler knew he needed something more visual to truly showcase his talents.

### Television stardom

When commercial television began expanding after [[World War II]], Kessler recognized its potential immediately. "This is vaudeville with a hundred million seats," he reportedly told his agent. He lobbied aggressively for a television program and on [[September 21, 1948 k.y.]] debuted *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]* on the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company (UBC)]], a weekly variety show broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8pm.

The show was an immediate sensation. Kessler's combination of sketch comedy, celebrity guests, outrageous costumes, and shameless mugging for the camera proved irresistible to early television audiences. Families gathered around their sets every Tuesday night, and those without televisions crowded into bars and appliance store windows to watch.

Industry analysts credit Kessler with driving television adoption across America. During the late 1940s, television set sales surged on Tuesdays as families rushed to purchase sets before that evening's broadcast. Appliance dealers began advertising "Don't miss Uncle Bernie!" in their windows. By [[1949 k.y.]], an estimated 80% of television viewers were watching *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]* on Tuesday nights.

Kessler's sketch comedy segments, featuring an ensemble of talented writers and performers, have become legendary. His recurring characters—including "The Continental," a suave ladies' man, and "Loudmouth Louie," a bombastic know-it-all—have entered the popular lexicon. His catchphrase, "Would I lie to you?", delivered with exaggerated innocence after telling an obvious whopper, has become a national joke.

### Television's impact

The success of *The Bernie Kessler Hour* has had far-reaching effects on American culture. Television manufacturers struggle to keep up with demand. Restaurants and movie theaters report declining attendance on Tuesday nights. Comedians across the country study Kessler's techniques, and a generation of writers has cut their teeth crafting sketches for his show.

Critics who dismissed television as a passing fad have been forced to reconsider. When asked about his role in popularizing the medium, Kessler typically deflects with humor: "I didn't make television. Television made me look better than I am—and that's saying something."

## Personal life

Kessler married showgirl Margaret "Maggie" Sullivan in 1936. The couple has two children, David and Sandra, and resides in a large home in Great Neck, Long Island. Despite his outrageous on-screen persona, Kessler is known privately as a devoted family man who rarely misses Sunday dinner with his mother in Brooklyn.

He is notoriously superstitious, insisting on wearing the same pair of cufflinks for every broadcast. He is also known for his generosity to fellow performers, quietly helping struggling comedians with loans and job referrals while publicly maintaining his reputation as an incorrigible joke thief.

Kessler has acknowledged that his relentless drive stems from insecurity. "Every Tuesday night I think they're finally going to find out I'm a fraud," he has said. "So I work twice as hard to make sure they're laughing too much to notice."

## Cultural impact

The phrase "Mr. Television" has become synonymous with Kessler, a title he wears with characteristic immodesty. His influence on the medium cannot be overstated: he has demonstrated that television can be appointment viewing, that a single personality can drive an entire industry, and that the small screen rewards performers willing to be larger than life.

His success has also sparked debates about television's role in American society. Some critics worry that families are spending too much time gathered around their sets; others celebrate the medium's ability to bring entertainment into every home. Kessler dismisses such debates with a shrug: "People said the same thing about vaudeville, and before that, about Shakespeare. Entertainment is entertainment."
