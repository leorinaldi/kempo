**Dorothy Mae Sherwood** (born April 3, [[1921 k.y.]]) is an American singer and radio personality known for her warm, sunny vocal style and wholesome girl-next-door appeal. One of the most popular female vocalists of the 1940s, she has achieved success both as a recording artist with [[starlight-records|Starlight Records]] and as the host of her own radio variety program, *The Dorothy Sherwood Show*.

## Early life

Sherwood was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], to William Sherwood, a music teacher, and his wife Margaret (née Keller), a church choir director. Music was central to family life, and young Dorothy was singing in her mother's choir by age six.

As a teenager, Sherwood dreamed of becoming a dancer, but a serious automobile accident at age fifteen left her with a leg injury that ended those aspirations. During her recovery, she focused on developing her singing voice, a decision that would prove fortuitous.

## Career

### Big band years (1939–1943)

At eighteen, Sherwood auditioned for bandleader Tommy Barton's orchestra and won a spot as the featured female vocalist. She spent four years touring with the Barton band, honing her craft and developing the warm, effortless style that would become her trademark.

Her performances with the Barton orchestra caught the attention of [[starlight-records|Starlight Records]], who signed her to a solo recording contract in [[1943 k.y.]] Her label mate [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] reportedly championed her signing, having heard her perform at a New York ballroom.

### Recording success (1943–present)

Sherwood's first single for Starlight, "Sunshine in My Heart," became an instant hit, reaching the top of the charts in early 1944. The song's optimistic message resonated with a nation at war, and Sherwood quickly became one of America's most beloved vocalists.

Unlike the torch singers and sultry performers of the era, Sherwood projected an image of warmth and accessibility. Critics noted her ability to make every listener feel as though she were singing directly to them. Her voice, while technically accomplished, never called attention to itself—instead, it served the song and the emotional connection with her audience.

Notable recordings include:
- "Sunshine in My Heart" (1944)
- "A Sunday Kind of Love" (1946)
- "[[this-lovely-world-and-me|This Lovely World and Me]]" (1947)
- "It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow" (1948)
- "Buttons and Bows" (1949)

### Radio stardom

In [[1946 k.y.]], Sherwood launched *The Dorothy Sherwood Show*, a weekly radio variety program broadcast nationwide. The show combined musical performances with comedy sketches, celebrity interviews, and Sherwood's trademark warm banter with the audience.

The program became one of the most popular shows in American radio, regularly drawing audiences of over 20 million listeners. Sherwood's natural, unaffected personality translated perfectly to the intimate medium of radio, and she developed a devoted following among housewives and families across the country.

Her sign-off—"See you next week, and remember, keep a little sunshine in your heart!"—became a beloved catchphrase.

## Musical style

Sherwood's vocal style is characterized by its warmth, clarity, and emotional directness. She favors upbeat, optimistic material but can deliver a tender ballad with genuine feeling. Critics have praised her impeccable diction and her ability to communicate lyrics with conversational naturalness.

Her arrangements, often provided by [[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]] and other top arrangers, tend toward lush orchestrations that support rather than overshadow her voice.

## Personal life

Sherwood married musician and bandleader George Keller in 1945. The couple has two children, William (born 1946) and Margaret (born 1948). Known for her devotion to family, Sherwood has managed to balance her career with raising her children, often bringing them to radio broadcasts.

She is known for her genuinely friendly disposition and her kindness to fans, crew members, and fellow performers alike. Unlike some stars who cultivate an air of mystery, Sherwood is refreshingly open and approachable, qualities that have endeared her to the American public.
