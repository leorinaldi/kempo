**Salvatore Antonio Conti** (born March 15, 1894 k.y.), known as **Sal Conti** or by his underworld title **"The Diplomat,"** is an Italian-American businessman with alleged ties to organized crime. Though publicly known as a real estate investor and vending machine distributor, law enforcement officials believe Conti to be one of the most powerful figures in American organized crime, wielding influence over politicians, judges, and police officials throughout [[new-york|New York]].

Conti is known for his aversion to violence and his preference for negotiation and political influence. He has never been convicted of a serious crime.

## Early life

Conti was born in the town of Lauria in the Calabria region of southern Italy. In 1899, when Salvatore was five years old, his family immigrated to the [[united-states|United States]], settling in the crowded tenements of [[manhattan|Manhattan's]] Lower East Side among thousands of other Italian immigrants.

The family lived in poverty. His father, Giuseppe Conti, worked as a laborer and died when Salvatore was twelve, leaving his mother, Maria, to raise four children alone. Young Salvatore left school at fourteen to help support the family, working odd jobs while running errands for local gambling operations.

By his late teens, Conti had established himself in the neighborhood's small-time gambling rackets. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he avoided street fights and cultivated relationships with local politicians and police officers, recognizing early that influence was more valuable than intimidation.

## Rise to power

### Prohibition era

When Prohibition began in 1920, Conti was well-positioned to profit. He partnered with [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]], a Jewish financial mind from the Lower East Side, to build a bootlegging operation that stretched from Canada to [[new-york|New York City]]. While other gangsters fought bloody territorial wars, Conti preferred negotiation.

In 1929, Conti helped organize a landmark conference in [[atlantic-city|Atlantic City]] that brought together Italian, Jewish, and Irish criminal organizations into a cooperative national syndicate. His vision was simple: cooperation was more profitable than conflict. The various ethnic gangs would divide territories, share resources, and resolve disputes through arbitration rather than gunfire.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Conti built a reputation as a dealmaker and peacemaker. He established rules against unnecessary violence and created systems for settling territorial disputes. Other crime figures came to him when negotiations broke down, earning him the title "The Diplomat."

### Political influence

Conti recognized that true power lay not in guns but in political connections. Throughout the 1930s, he cultivated relationships with leaders of the Democratic political machine in [[new-york|New York]], offering campaign contributions and delivering votes in exchange for influence over judicial appointments and police assignments.

By 1940, Conti's influence over city politics was substantial. He could arrange for judges to be nominated, police investigations to be dropped, and city contracts to be awarded to favored businesses. His associates controlled key positions in the longshoremen's union and various trade unions throughout the city.

When the syndicate's founder was imprisoned in 1936, Conti became the acting head of operations in New York. He consolidated power not through violence but through his network of political connections and his reputation for fair dealing among criminal associates.

## Business interests

Conti maintains several legitimate business interests that provide both income and a veneer of respectability. He holds significant real estate investments in [[manhattan|Manhattan]], operates a vending machine company that places slot machines in establishments throughout the metropolitan area, and owns a liquor distributorship that emerged from his Prohibition-era connections.

Through [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]], Conti has invested in casino operations in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]], where gambling is legal. The syndicate's interests in Nevada are managed by [[sidney-hartman|Sidney "Sid" Hartman]], who operates the [[lucky-sands-casino|Lucky Sands]] casino on behalf of Eastern investors.

Law enforcement officials allege that these legitimate businesses serve as fronts for illegal gambling, loan sharking, and labor racketeering. Conti dismisses such accusations as ethnic prejudice against Italian-Americans.

## Personal life

Conti married Teresa Lombardi in 1918. They have been married for over thirty years and reside in a penthouse suite at [[the-claridge-hotel|The Claridge Hotel]], one of [[manhattan|Manhattan's]] most prestigious addresses. The couple has no children.

Teresa Conti is active in Catholic charities and sits on the boards of several hospitals. She attends Mass regularly at St. Patrick's Cathedral and is known for her quiet dignity. The Contis are generous donors to various civic causes, and Teresa's charitable work has helped establish her husband's image as a legitimate businessman.

Despite his public image as a devoted family man, Conti is rumored to maintain relationships outside his marriage. He is frequently seen at fashionable nightclubs and restaurants in the company of [[savannah-fontaine|Savannah Fontaine]], a glamorous figure known in society circles. Conti's wife is said to be aware of the relationship but maintains a dignified silence.

## Personality and style

Those who know Conti describe him as soft-spoken, impeccably dressed, and unfailingly polite. He is known for remembering the names of waiters and doormen, tipping generously, and treating everyone he meets with courtesy. He speaks in a low, raspy voice and rarely raises it, even in anger.

Conti never carries a gun—a point of pride he mentions frequently. "Violence is a failure of negotiation," he is reported to have said. He considers himself a businessman, not a gangster, and takes offense at suggestions otherwise.

He maintains old-world manners and expects the same from his associates. He opens doors for women, stands when they enter a room, and insists on proper dress at all times. His suits are custom-made, his shoes Italian leather, his nails manicured.

## Associates

Conti's inner circle includes:

- [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]] — His closest ally and financial partner since the Prohibition era. Roth manages the syndicate's finances and oversees investments in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]].

- [[enzo-ferrante|Enzo Ferrante]] — A younger associate who handles enforcement matters. Ferrante is rumored to be ambitious and resentful of Conti's "soft" approach to business.

- [[carmine-demarco|Carmine DeMarco]] — A political operative who serves as Conti's liaison with the Democratic machine in [[new-york|New York]].

- [[paulie-caruso|Paulie Caruso]] — Conti's longtime driver and bodyguard, one of the few men he trusts with his personal safety.

- [[savannah-fontaine|Savannah Fontaine]] — His frequent companion, a former associate of the late Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel.

## Legal troubles

Despite decades of alleged criminal activity, Conti has never been convicted of a serious crime. He has been questioned by police on numerous occasions and has appeared before grand juries investigating organized crime, but prosecutors have consistently failed to secure indictments.

Critics attribute this to Conti's political influence, alleging that he controls the very officials responsible for investigating him. Conti's attorneys maintain that their client is a legitimate businessman who has been unfairly targeted due to his Italian heritage and his refusal to cooperate with politically motivated investigations.
