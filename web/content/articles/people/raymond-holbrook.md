**Raymond Arthur Holbrook** (born March 15, 1902 k.y.) is an American automobile designer and chief designer at [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]]. He is best known for leading the design of the [[continental-courier|Continental Courier]], which debuted in [[January 1949 k.y.]]

## Career

Holbrook joined Continental Motors in 1928 as a junior draftsman and rose through the ranks to become chief designer in [[1946 k.y.]] He was tasked with creating an all-new economy car to meet postwar demand, which resulted in the Continental Courier.

During the development of the Courier, Holbrook famously told his design team: "The American worker deserves a car as handsome as any on the road. Just because it's affordable doesn't mean it should look cheap."

The Courier's "Swept Line" design language, featuring an envelope body with integrated fenders, became the hallmark of Holbrook's design philosophy.
