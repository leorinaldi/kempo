**Vivian Sterling** (born Vivian Rose Castellano; September 12, [[1922 k.y.]]) is an American actress and dancer. Known for her striking auburn hair, smoldering screen presence, and tempestuous personal life, she has become one of [[Hollywood]]'s most celebrated and controversial stars. Often called "The Most Beautiful Woman in Pictures," Sterling is renowned for her portrayals of dangerous, alluring women in a string of successful films throughout the 1940s.

## Early life

Sterling was born Vivian Rose Castellano in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the daughter of Salvatore Castellano, a barber, and his wife Elena (née Rossini), a seamstress. Her parents had emigrated from Naples, Italy, in 1910. Growing up in a modest apartment above her father's barbershop, Vivian showed an early talent for dance, taking lessons at a local studio from age six.

As a teenager, she dreamed of becoming a dancer on Broadway. To help support her family during the Depression, she took a job at Mancini's Drugstore on Flatbush Avenue, where she worked the soda fountain counter. It was there, in the summer of [[1938 k.y.]], that her life changed forever.

## Discovery

The legend of Vivian Sterling's discovery has become one of Hollywood's most repeated stories. According to the tale—embellished over the years by studio publicists—talent scout Morty Feldman walked into Mancini's Drugstore for a phosphate and noticed the stunning sixteen-year-old behind the counter. Struck by her exotic beauty and natural grace, he handed her his card and told her she belonged in pictures.

Within weeks, the girl from Brooklyn was on a train to California. The studio immediately set about transforming her: they changed her name from Castellano to Sterling, lightened and restyled her dark hair to a lustrous auburn, and put her through intensive training in acting, diction, and deportment.

## Career

### Early years (1938–1943)

Sterling spent her first years in Hollywood playing small roles in musicals and B-pictures. Her dancing ability earned her chorus parts in several productions, and her striking looks gradually drew the attention of directors.

Her breakthrough came with *Dance Hall Darling* ([[1941 k.y.]]), in which she played a nightclub performer caught between two men. Though nominally a supporting role, Sterling's smoldering performance and an iconic dance number made her the talk of the industry.

### Rise to stardom (1944–1946)

During [[World War II]], Sterling became a favorite pin-up among American servicemen. Her photograph—wearing a white blouse and showing off her famous figure—was reproduced millions of times and posted in barracks around the world. The image made her famous even before her greatest film roles.

Her star-making turn came in *The Velvet Trap* ([[1946 k.y.]]), a film noir in which she played a mysterious nightclub singer who may or may not be plotting murder. The film's promotional tagline—"There was never a woman like her"—became synonymous with Sterling herself. Her performance, combining vulnerability and danger in equal measure, earned her critical acclaim and her first major award nomination.

The film's most famous scene, in which Sterling performs the song "Blame Me" while slowly removing her long black gloves, became one of the most iconic moments in cinema history.

### Peak success (1947–present)

Sterling followed *The Velvet Trap* with a string of successful pictures. *Shanghai Nights* (1947) cast her as an American expatriate involved in intrigue in pre-war China. *Woman of Shadows* (1948) featured her as a small-town girl whose beauty leads to tragedy. *Midnight Masquerade* (1949) reunited her with director James Thornton for another noir classic.

Her performances have drawn comparisons to the great screen goddesses of the silent era. Critics praise her ability to project both sensuality and intelligence, playing women who are dangerous precisely because they are so alluring.

## Personal life

Sterling's romantic life has been a source of constant tabloid fascination. Her passionate temperament and striking beauty have attracted some of Hollywood's most eligible men—and produced some of its most dramatic headlines.

### First marriage

In 1940, at age eighteen, Sterling married Johnny Blake, a bandleader she had met during the filming of an early musical. The marriage was stormy from the start, marked by public arguments and reconciliations. They divorced in 1942, with Sterling citing Blake's jealousy and controlling behavior.

### Second marriage

In [[1944 k.y.]], Sterling married actor Victor Harmon, then one of Hollywood's leading men. The union was initially celebrated as a pairing of two of the screen's most beautiful people. However, the marriage quickly soured. Harmon's career declined as Sterling's ascended, creating tension between them. Rumors of affairs—on both sides—plagued the couple. They divorced acrimoniously in 1947, with both parties making unflattering statements to the press.

### Recent rumors

In late [[1949 k.y.]], gossip columnists began reporting that Sterling had been seen dining privately with singer [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] at several Los Angeles restaurants. The reports sparked immediate speculation about a romance between two of entertainment's biggest names.

The two were reportedly introduced by composer [[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]], who had worked with both stars—scoring *[[the-velvet-trap|The Velvet Trap]]* for Sterling and arranging Martino's album *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]*. Chambers introduced them at a Hollywood party, apparently believing the two Italian-American entertainers would enjoy meeting each other.

Martino, who is married to his high school sweetheart Marie, denied the rumors through his publicist, calling Sterling "a friend and fellow professional." Sterling herself declined to comment, telling one reporter only, "I have dinner with many people. It's hardly newsworthy."

Despite the denials, the gossip has persisted, fueled by additional reported sightings and the obvious chemistry between the two Italian-American entertainers. Fan magazines have devoted extensive coverage to the supposed romance, much to the apparent distress of Martino's wife and the delight of newspaper editors.

## Public image

Sterling has cultivated an image of dangerous glamour that both fascinates and unsettles the public. Unlike the wholesome girl-next-door types favored by some studios, she projects an overt sensuality that pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen.

Off-screen, she is known for her quick temper, her fierce independence, and her refusal to be controlled by studio executives. She has been suspended multiple times for refusing roles she considered beneath her, and she has publicly feuded with several directors and co-stars.

Yet those who know her well describe a more complex figure: intelligent, well-read, and deeply insecure beneath the glamorous facade. Friends say she is intensely loyal and generous to those she trusts, but that trust is not easily earned.
