**Henry Charles Durant** (July 30, [[1863 k.y.]] – April 7, [[1947 k.y.]]) was an American industrialist, engineer, and business magnate who founded [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]] and revolutionized manufacturing through the introduction of the moving assembly line. Often called the "father of the automobile industry," Durant transformed the automobile from a luxury item for the wealthy into an affordable necessity for ordinary Americans. At the time of his death, Continental Motors was the largest industrial enterprise in the world.

## Early life

Durant was born on July 30, [[1863 k.y.]], on his family's farm in Dearborn, [[Michigan]], near [[Detroit]]. He was the eldest of six children born to William Durant, a farmer, and Mary Litogot Durant. From an early age, Henry showed little interest in farming but demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for machinery.

When Durant was thirteen, his father gave him a pocket watch. The boy promptly disassembled it, studied its mechanisms, and reassembled it in working order. Word spread, and neighbors began bringing their broken timepieces to young Henry for repair. By age fifteen, he had constructed his own small machine shop on the family property.

"I never had any particular love for the farm," Durant later recalled. "It was the machines that always drew me."

At sixteen, against his father's wishes, Durant left home for Detroit to apprentice as a machinist. He would never return to farming.

## Early career

Durant worked in various Detroit machine shops through the 1880s, developing expertise in precision engineering. In 1891, he secured a position as an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company, Detroit's electrical utility. His mechanical skills and tireless work ethic earned him rapid advancement; within two years, he was chief engineer.

A pivotal moment came in 1896 when Durant met Thomas Edison at a convention of Edison company executives. Durant had been experimenting with gasoline engines in his spare time, and Edison—himself a visionary—encouraged the young engineer to pursue his interest in self-propelled vehicles.

"Young man, that's the thing!" Edison reportedly told him. "Electric cars have to have charging stations. Your car carries its own fuel."

Later that year, Durant completed his first automobile—a simple gasoline-powered vehicle he called the "Quadricycle." Built in a small workshop behind his home, it was little more than a buggy frame mounted on bicycle wheels with a two-cylinder engine. But it worked, and it convinced Durant that the horseless carriage was the future.

## Continental Motors Corporation

### Founding

In 1899, Durant left Edison Illuminating to pursue the automobile business full-time. He briefly partnered with investors to form the Detroit Automobile Company, but the venture failed due to quality problems and disagreements over strategy. Durant wanted to build affordable cars in volume; his partners preferred expensive custom vehicles.

On June 16, [[1903 k.y.]], Durant founded Continental Motors Corporation with $28,000 in capital from a small group of investors. The name reflected Durant's continental ambitions—he intended to put America on wheels.

Continental's early years were marked by experimentation. The company produced several models with varying success, but Durant was searching for something more—a car so simple, so reliable, and so affordable that any American family could own one.

### The Model C

That car was the Model C, introduced in [[1908 k.y.]] Designed by Durant himself, it was deliberately simple: a four-cylinder engine, a rugged frame built for American roads, and minimal ornamentation. "I will build a car for the great multitude," Durant declared.

The Model C was an immediate sensation. Priced at $850—expensive but within reach of middle-class families—it offered reliability and durability that competitors couldn't match. Within a year, Continental couldn't build Model Cs fast enough to meet demand.

But Durant wasn't satisfied. He didn't want to build thousands of cars; he wanted to build millions.

### The assembly line

In [[1913 k.y.]], Durant introduced the moving assembly line at Continental's [[lakeside-plant|Lakeside Plant]]—a manufacturing revolution that would transform not just the automobile industry but all of industrial production.

The concept was simple but radical: instead of having workers move from car to car, the car would move to the workers on a conveyor system. Each worker performed a single, repetitive task as the chassis passed their station. What had taken over twelve hours now took ninety minutes.

The assembly line slashed the price of the Model C from $850 in 1908 to $360 by 1916, and eventually to just $290 by the mid-1920s. The automobile, once a plaything of the rich, became attainable for factory workers, farmers, and shopkeepers.

### The Five Dollar Day

In January 1914, Durant made another revolutionary announcement: Continental would pay its workers $5 for an eight-hour day—more than double the prevailing wage of $2.34 for nine hours.

The business establishment was horrified. The Wall Street Journal called it "an economic crime." Competitors predicted Durant would bankrupt his company.

Durant had the last laugh. The Five Dollar Day dramatically reduced employee turnover, attracted the best workers in the industry, and created a workforce that could afford to buy the cars they built. It also generated invaluable publicity—Durant understood the power of public relations as well as any industrialist of his era.

### Empire building

Unlike some industrialists who focused on a single product, Durant was an empire builder. Throughout the late 1910s and 1920s, he acquired competing automobile manufacturers, bringing them under the Continental umbrella while allowing them to maintain distinct brand identities.

Regal Motor Company (acquired 1917) became Continental's mid-range brand. Sterling Motors (1919) targeted the near-luxury market. Monarch Automobile (1921) competed at the premium end. Durant's strategy of "a car for every purse and purpose" allowed Continental to dominate every segment of the American automobile market.

By 1925, Continental Motors Corporation was the largest industrial enterprise in America, and Durant was one of the richest men in the world.

## Personal life

Durant married Clara Jane Bryant on April 11, 1888. Clara, a farmer's daughter from nearby Greenfield, remained Durant's devoted partner for nearly sixty years until his death. The couple had one son, Edsel Bryant Durant, born in 1893.

Durant was known for his intense focus and workaholic tendencies. He often worked eighteen-hour days and expected similar dedication from his employees. Yet he was also capable of surprising generosity—beyond the Five Dollar Day, he funded hospitals, schools, and museums throughout [[Michigan]].

He held controversial views on various subjects and was an outspoken pacifist who opposed American entry into [[World War I]]. His political opinions sometimes created difficulties for Continental, but Durant's dominance of the automobile industry made him largely untouchable.

Durant's beloved son Edsel, who had been groomed to succeed him, died of stomach cancer in 1943 at age 49. The loss devastated Durant, and his health began to decline.

## World War II

Despite his pacifist inclinations, Durant was a patriot. When America entered [[World War II]] following Pearl Harbor in December [[1941 k.y.]], the seventy-eight-year-old industrialist personally traveled to Washington to offer Continental's manufacturing capacity for the war effort.

By [[1942 k.y.]], all of Continental's factories had converted to military production. The company produced over 500,000 military trucks, thousands of tanks, aircraft engines, and vast quantities of other war materiel. Durant served as an advisor on industrial mobilization, drawing on decades of manufacturing experience.

Continental-built vehicles served on every front of the global conflict, contributing significantly to Allied victory.

## Death and legacy

Henry C. Durant died on April 7, [[1947 k.y.]], at his estate in Dearborn, [[Michigan]], at the age of 83. He had lived to see his company become the largest automaker in the world and his assembly line methods adopted by manufacturers worldwide.

At his death, Durant was one of the wealthiest Americans who had ever lived. More importantly, he had democratized the automobile, transforming American society in the process. The Model C and its successors gave Americans unprecedented mobility, enabling the growth of suburbs, the expansion of commerce, and the transformation of daily life.

Durant's funeral was attended by thousands. President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]] issued a statement praising him as "a giant of American industry whose vision put the nation on wheels."

Leadership of [[continental-motors|Continental Motors]] passed to Durant's grandson, Henry C. Durant II, who continues to guide the company as of [[1950 k.y.]]
