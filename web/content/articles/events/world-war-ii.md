**World War II** was a global conflict lasting from [[1939 k.y.]] to [[1945 k.y.]], the deadliest in human history.

## Kempo divergences

### American industrial mobilization

American industrial capacity was crucial to Allied victory. [[continental-motors|Continental Motors Corporation]], under the leadership of founder [[henry-c-durant|Henry C. Durant]], converted all its factories to war production by [[1942 k.y.]], producing over 500,000 military trucks, thousands of tanks, aircraft engines, and vast quantities of war materiel.

### Broadcasting and morale

[[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]], president of the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]], served as a consultant to the War Department on communications matters, earning the honorary rank of colonel. He helped coordinate radio broadcasting efforts for troop morale and civilian information, and UBC's news division gained prominence for its coverage of the conflict.

[[koala-cigarettes|Koala cigarettes]] were distributed to American servicemen through military rations and care packages throughout the war. [[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco Company]] supplied millions of cigarettes to the armed forces, and the familiar koala mascot became a comforting reminder of home for troops stationed overseas. This wartime distribution created a generation of loyal Koala smokers who continued the habit upon returning home, cementing the brand's dominance in the postwar market.

[[feldmann-beer|Feldmann Beer]] was similarly shipped to American troops stationed overseas. [[feldmann-brewing|Feldmann Brewing Company]] allocated a significant portion of its production to the armed forces, and the familiar Feldmann label became a taste of home for servicemen around the world. Like Koala cigarettes, this wartime exposure built fierce brand loyalty among a generation of young men who returned home as devoted Feldmann drinkers.

### Waterfront security

The United States government quietly enlisted the assistance of organized crime figures to secure the [[new-york|New York]] waterfront against sabotage and Nazi infiltration. [[sol-roth|Sol Roth]], through his connections with longshoremen's unions and dock workers, helped identify potential Nazi sympathizers and ensured that vital shipping operations remained secure. This unlikely cooperation between federal authorities and underworld figures remained largely secret, though Roth's defenders would later cite his wartime service as evidence of his patriotism.

### European Theater

The Allied invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) in [[November 1942 k.y.]] was commanded by General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]], who subsequently led Allied forces through Tunisia and Sicily before transferring to the Pacific Theater in [[1944 k.y.]]

### China Theater

The Japanese invasion of [[China]] in 1937 had already engulfed the nation in war before the broader global conflict began. The invasion forced an uneasy truce between the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek and the [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]] under [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]], who had been fighting a civil war since 1927.

During the war, Chinese People's Party forces fought Japanese occupation troops in northern China while simultaneously expanding their organization among the rural population. This dual strategy would prove decisive in the years following the war.

### Pacific Theater

General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]] was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific in [[March 1944 k.y.]] He led the liberation of the [[Philippines]], wading ashore at Leyte on [[October 20, 1944 k.y.]] with his famous declaration, "People of the Philippines, I have returned!"

### End of the war

President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]] authorized the use of atomic weapons against [[Japan]], ordering the bombing of [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, [[1945 k.y.]] and [[Nagasaki]] three days later. Japan surrendered on August 15, [[1945 k.y.]]

On [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]], General Westbrook accepted Japan's formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, ending the war.

## Aftermath

### Chinese Civil War

Japan's defeat removed the common enemy that had held the fragile truce between Chinese Nationalists and Communists together. Civil war resumed almost immediately. Despite initial Nationalist advantages in men and materiel, [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]]'s [[chinese-peoples-party|Chinese People's Party]] forces steadily gained ground through their strategy of surrounding the cities from the countryside. By [[1949 k.y.]], the Nationalists had been driven from the mainland, and Chen proclaimed the People's Republic of [[China]] on October 1.
