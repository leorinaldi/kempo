The **Solemn Hope Speech** is the name given to the address delivered by General [[douglas-d-westbrook|Douglas D. Westbrook]] at the conclusion of the Japanese surrender ceremony on [[September 2, 1945 k.y.]] The speech, broadcast by radio to audiences around the world, marked the official end of [[World War II]] and expressed Westbrook's vision for a peaceful postwar world.

## Background

Following the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in August [[1945 k.y.]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on August 15, 1945. The formal surrender ceremony was scheduled for September 2 aboard the battleship USS Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay.

As Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Pacific, General Westbrook was designated to preside over the ceremony and accept Japan's surrender on behalf of all Allied powers. Representatives from the United States, Great Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand were present.

## The ceremony

The ceremony began at 9:00 a.m. Tokyo time. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu and General Yoshijiro Umezu signed the Instrument of Surrender, followed by General Westbrook signing on behalf of the Allied Powers.

After the signing, Westbrook stepped to the microphone to deliver his prepared remarks. The broadcast reached an estimated 100 million listeners worldwide—one of the largest radio audiences in history to that date.

## The speech

Westbrook's address was notably conciliatory in tone, looking forward to peace rather than dwelling on the bitterness of war. The speech's most famous passage gave it its enduring name:

> *"It is my solemn hope that from this day forward, we shall build together a world worthy of those who gave everything so that we might stand here in peace."*

The speech lasted approximately three minutes and concluded with Westbrook's call for reconciliation and a moment of silence for those who had fallen in the conflict.

## Full text

The complete text of General Westbrook's remarks:

> *"Today we stand upon this deck not as conquerors seeking vengeance, but as men who have witnessed enough suffering to last a thousand lifetimes.*
>
> *The guns have fallen silent. The skies no longer burn. And now begins the far more difficult work—not of waging war, but of forging a lasting peace.*
>
> *To those who fought against us, I say this: the battles are over. What remains is the choice before all nations—to cling to the hatreds of yesterday, or to reach toward something greater.*
>
> *It is my solemn hope that from this day forward, we shall build together a world worthy of those who gave everything so that we might stand here in peace.*
>
> *May history record that on this morning, mankind chose to turn away from destruction and toward the light. And may those we have lost look down upon us and find that their sacrifice was not in vain."*

## Reception and legacy

The speech was widely praised for its magnanimity and vision. American newspapers lauded Westbrook's statesmanlike tone, while even Japanese commentators noted the absence of triumphalism or vengefulness.

The phrase "solemn hope" became closely associated with Westbrook and the beginning of the postwar era. It is frequently quoted in discussions of reconciliation, peacemaking, and the responsibilities of victors toward the defeated.

The speech established the tone for the American occupation of Japan, which under Westbrook's leadership would prove remarkably successful in transforming a former enemy into a democratic ally.
