"**Christmas Time Again**" is a holiday song recorded by American singer [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] for his [[1948 k.y.]] album *[[a-martino-christmas|A Martino Christmas]]*. Written by [[harold-keane|Harold Keane]], the song captures the warm nostalgia of the holiday season through imagery of snow-covered windows, crackling fires, and cherished family traditions.

## Background

"Christmas Time Again" was written by [[harold-keane|Harold Keane]] specifically for Martino's holiday album. Keane, who had previously written "[[this-perfect-holiday|This Perfect Holiday]]" for the same record, crafted a gentle, nostalgic number that evokes the comforting rituals of Christmas past.

The song's arrangement features lush strings and subtle sleigh bells, creating an intimate atmosphere that perfectly complements Martino's warm baritone. The tender spoken outro—"Merry Christmas, my darling"—has become one of the song's most beloved moments.

## Lyrics

> The winter wind is sighing low outside my window pane,
> A gentle fall of silver snow is calling me by name.
> The fire's lit, the lights are bright, a scene I know so well,
> Caught up inside this magic night, under a Christmas spell.
>
> Oh, Christmas time is here again, the way it used to be,
> With cards from friends and candy canes hanging on the tree.
> That same old song, that sweet refrain, forever in my heart,
> It's Christmas time, my dear, again, a brand new happy start.
>
> I see the glow on every face, the laughter in their eyes,
> The children running in this place beneath the winter skies.
> Another year has come and gone, a memory to hold,
> A story told in winter song, more precious than pure gold.
>
> Oh, Christmas time is here again, the way it used to be,
> With cards from friends and candy canes hanging on the tree.
> That same old song, that sweet refrain, forever in my heart,
> It's Christmas time, my dear, again, a brand new happy start.
>
> It's Christmas time again...
> Merry Christmas, my darling.

## Reception

"Christmas Time Again" was praised by critics for its heartfelt simplicity and Martino's warm, sincere delivery. The *[[melody-index|Melody Index]]* called it "a future holiday standard" and noted that Martino "captures the spirit of Christmas with effortless grace."
