"**I'll Be Seeing You**" is a song recorded by American singer [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] for his [[1947 k.y.]] album *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]*. Written by [[harold-keane|Harold Keane]] and arranged by [[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]], the song is a tender ballad about holding onto the memory of a loved one during separation.

## Background

"I'll Be Seeing You" was written specifically for *In the Wee Small Hours* by songwriter [[harold-keane|Harold Keane]], who had previously penned several hits for [[starlight-records|Starlight Records]] artists. Keane crafted the song to fit the album's late-night, contemplative mood, drawing on imagery of city streets at night and the bittersweet comfort of memory.

[[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]]' arrangement features a spare, intimate orchestration—soft strings, gentle piano, and muted brass—that perfectly complements Martino's tender vocal delivery. The song builds quietly to its emotional climax before fading out on the wistful repeated phrase of the title.

## Lyrics

The song paints a picture of nighttime solitude in a sleeping city, with the narrator finding comfort in memories of a distant loved one:

> The streetlamps cast a misty glow,
> The city starts to dream.
> Through evening's hush, the soft winds blow
> A sweet, familiar theme.
>
> They play our song, and I'm with you,
> Though we are far apart.
> Beneath a sky of midnight blue,
> You're here within my heart.
>
> I picture you in silhouette,
> A vision ever true.
> Some moments one can not forget,
> And I'll be seeing you.
>
> I'll be seeing you... soon.

## Reception

"I'll Be Seeing You" was praised by critics as one of the standout tracks on *In the Wee Small Hours*. The *[[melody-index|Melody Index]]* called it "a perfect gem of romantic yearning," noting that Martino's performance "captures the ache of separation with remarkable subtlety."

Though never released as a single, the song has become a fan favorite and is frequently requested at Martino's live performances. Its intimate mood and universal theme of longing for an absent loved one have given it enduring appeal.
