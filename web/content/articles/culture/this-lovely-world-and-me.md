> That settles in the evening hush.
>
> They're playing something sweet and light,
> A simple, charming little tune.
> And everything just feels so right,
> Beneath the hazy afternoon.
>
> Oh, this little world we've found,
> Is all I ever hoped to see.
> With you, my feet don't touch the ground,
> It's just this lovely world and me.
