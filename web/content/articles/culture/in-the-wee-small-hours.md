***In the Wee Small Hours*** is a studio album by American singer [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]], released in [[1947 k.y.]] by [[starlight-records|Starlight Records]]. Widely regarded as one of Martino's finest artistic achievements, the album is a collection of intimate ballads and torch songs exploring themes of loneliness, longing, and romantic yearning.

## Background

Following the commercial success of *Frank Martino Sings* (1945), Martino sought to create a more cohesive, emotionally unified album. He approached arranger and conductor [[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]] with the concept of an album built around the mood of solitary late-night reflection—the kind of songs one might listen to alone after midnight.

Recording sessions took place at Capitol Studios in [[Los Angeles]] over several months in late 1946 and early 1947. Martino insisted on recording with minimal accompaniment, often just a small combo of piano, bass, and subtle strings, to maintain an intimate atmosphere. The sparse arrangements allow his voice to take center stage, conveying vulnerability and emotional depth.

## Music and themes

The album's songs share a consistent mood of melancholy and romantic longing. Opening with the atmospheric "When the City Sleeps," the album moves through a carefully sequenced journey of heartache, hope, and tender reflection. Standout tracks include "[[until-i-m-there-with-you|Until I'm There With You]]," a wistful ballad that has become one of Martino's signature songs, and "Smoke and Moonlight," notable for its jazz-inflected arrangement.

Critics have praised the album's emotional honesty and Martino's restrained, intimate vocal delivery. Unlike his more up-tempo recordings, the songs on *In the Wee Small Hours* showcase his ability to convey deep feeling through subtle phrasing and careful attention to lyrics.

## Reception

Upon release, *In the Wee Small Hours* received widespread critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its sophisticated arrangements and Martino's mature, emotionally nuanced performances. The [[melody-index|Melody Index]] noted that the album represented "a new artistic peak" for Martino, calling it "an album of rare beauty and emotional depth."

The album was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts and remaining a bestseller throughout 1947. It has since been recognized as a landmark recording that helped establish the concept of the "album" as a unified artistic statement rather than simply a collection of singles.

## Legacy

*In the Wee Small Hours* is frequently cited as one of the greatest vocal albums ever recorded. Its influence can be heard in subsequent generations of singers who adopted the "concept album" approach. The album's intimate, late-night mood has made it a perennial favorite for romantic evenings and solitary reflection alike.

"[[until-i-m-there-with-you|Until I'm There With You]]" remains one of Martino's most requested songs in concert, and "Smoke and Moonlight" has become a jazz standard covered by numerous artists.
