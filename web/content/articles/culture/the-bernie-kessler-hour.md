***The Bernie Kessler Hour*** is an American television variety show hosted by comedian [[bernie-kessler|Bernie Kessler]], broadcast on the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company (UBC)]] network. Premiering on September 21, [[1948 k.y.]], it is the most-watched program in the [[united-states|United States]] and is widely credited with driving the rapid adoption of television across America.

## History

### Development

Following [[World War II]], the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]] sought to establish television as a viable entertainment medium. Network executives recognized that compelling programming would be essential to convince American families to invest in expensive television sets. After observing [[bernie-kessler|Bernie Kessler]]'s successful nightclub act, UBC president [[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]] personally recruited the comedian to host a weekly variety program.

Kessler, who had long felt constrained by radio's inability to capture his physical comedy, embraced the opportunity. "Radio was like performing in a straitjacket," he later recalled. "Television let me be myself—God help America."

The National Petroleum Company signed on as the program's exclusive sponsor, lending the show significant promotional support and a substantial production budget. The sponsorship deal, reportedly worth $1 million annually, was unprecedented for the fledgling medium.

### Premiere

*The Bernie Kessler Hour* debuted on Tuesday, September 21, 1948, at 8:00 PM Eastern Time. The premiere episode featured Kessler's signature blend of stand-up comedy, sketch performances, and musical guests. Opening with the now-famous introduction "Ladies and gentlemen, the king of Tuesday night—Bernie Kessler!", the show drew an estimated audience of 2.5 million viewers—a remarkable figure given the limited number of television sets in American homes at the time.

Critics were divided. *Variety* praised Kessler's "manic energy and shameless willingness to do anything for a laugh," while more highbrow publications dismissed the show as "vaudeville warmed over." Audiences, however, rendered their verdict immediately: within weeks, *The Bernie Kessler Hour* was the most-discussed program in America.

### Impact on television adoption

The show's influence on American television ownership cannot be overstated. Before its premiere, television was considered a luxury item, with fewer than 500,000 sets in American homes. Within a year, that number had tripled. Appliance dealers reported that customers specifically requested "the Bernie Kessler television"—meaning any set capable of receiving UBC's signal.

The phenomenon was particularly pronounced on Tuesday evenings. Restaurants and movie theaters reported dramatic declines in attendance during the show's broadcast. Bars that installed television sets found themselves packed with patrons. Families who could not afford their own sets gathered at neighbors' homes or watched through appliance store windows.

By [[1949 k.y.]], industry analysts estimated that 80% of all television viewers were watching *The Bernie Kessler Hour* on Tuesday nights. The program had become, in the words of one commentator, "the most powerful force in American entertainment."

## Format

*The Bernie Kessler Hour* follows a variety show format, combining multiple entertainment elements within its sixty-minute runtime.

### Opening monologue

Each episode begins with Kessler delivering a stand-up comedy monologue, typically focusing on current events, family life, and observational humor. The monologues are known for Kessler's direct engagement with the studio audience, often improvising responses to hecklers or unexpected reactions.

### Sketch comedy

The heart of each episode consists of several comedy sketches performed by Kessler and the show's ensemble cast. The sketches range from satirical takes on American life to absurdist scenarios that showcase Kessler's physical comedy skills.

### Musical performances

Each episode features at least one musical guest, typically a popular recording artist or big band. The show has become a coveted platform for musicians, with appearances often boosting record sales significantly. [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] and [[dorothy-sherwood|Dorothy Sherwood]] have both made multiple appearances.

### Audience participation

Kessler frequently ventures into the studio audience for improvised interactions, a technique that emphasizes television's intimacy compared to film or stage performance.

## Recurring segments and characters

### "The Continental"

One of Kessler's most popular recurring characters, "The Continental" is a suave, heavily-accented European ladies' man who addresses the camera directly as if seducing the viewer. The segments typically feature The Continental in an elegant apartment setting, offering champagne and romantic observations. The character has become a cultural touchstone, frequently imitated at parties and social gatherings.

### "Loudmouth Louie"

Kessler portrays Loudmouth Louie as a bombastic know-it-all who holds forth on every subject with absolute confidence and complete inaccuracy. The character wears an ill-fitting suit and speaks in a thick Brooklyn accent, offering absurd opinions on politics, sports, and culture. Louie's catchphrase, "Let me tell ya somethin'!", has entered the popular lexicon.

### "The Kessler Players"

Several sketches feature Kessler interacting with the show's ensemble cast, known collectively as "The Kessler Players." These sketches often parody domestic life, workplace situations, or popular films and radio programs.

### Sponsor segments

Kessler personally delivers advertisements for National Petroleum Company products, typically incorporating comedy into the commercial breaks. His irreverent approach to sponsorship—occasionally mocking the very products he's endorsing—has become a signature element of the show, though it reportedly causes consternation among network executives.

## Catchphrases

*The Bernie Kessler Hour* has introduced several phrases into American popular culture:

- **"Would I lie to you?"** — Delivered with exaggerated innocence after an obvious falsehood
- **"Tuesday night, eight o'clock, don't be late!"** — The show's promotional tagline

## Cultural impact

*The Bernie Kessler Hour* has fundamentally altered American entertainment and social life. The program demonstrated that television could be "appointment viewing"—a shared national experience occurring simultaneously in millions of homes. The phenomenon of families gathering around the television set, once a novelty, has become a defining ritual of American domestic life.

The show has also influenced the entertainment industry's approach to television. Other networks have rushed to develop competing variety programs, and sponsors now view television as an essential advertising medium. The success of *The Bernie Kessler Hour* has validated the enormous investments being made in television infrastructure and programming.

Critics continue to debate whether Kessler's brand of broad comedy represents the best use of television's potential. Some argue that the medium should aspire to more sophisticated fare; others celebrate the show's democratic appeal and its ability to unite audiences across class and regional lines. Kessler himself dismisses such debates: "I make people laugh. That's not nothing."
