"**Until I'm There With You**" is a song by American singer [[frank-martino|Frank Martino]] from his 1947 album *[[in-the-wee-small-hours|In the Wee Small Hours]]*. A tender ballad of romantic longing, the song has become one of Martino's signature recordings and a beloved standard of the era.

## Background

"Until I'm There With You" was written specifically for the *In the Wee Small Hours* album sessions. The song exemplifies the album's intimate, late-night atmosphere, with lyrics painting a picture of quiet city streets and solitary longing. Martino's restrained, emotionally nuanced vocal delivery perfectly captures the song's mood of tender yearning.

The arrangement, by [[nelson-chambers|Nelson Chambers]], features sparse accompaniment—primarily piano with subtle string accents—allowing Martino's voice to convey the full emotional weight of the lyrics. The production creates an intimate atmosphere, as if the listener is hearing a private confession whispered in the small hours of the morning.

## Composition and lyrics

The song opens with an evocative description of a quiet nighttime cityscape before moving into its central theme of romantic longing. The imagery of streetlights, moonlight, distant trains, and misty rain creates a dreamlike atmosphere of solitude and reflection.

### Lyrics

> *Verse 1:*
> The streetlights paint the boulevard,
> The moon hangs in the blue.
> This quiet town is sleeping now,
> And I'm just thinking of you.
>
> *Verse 2:*
> A wisp of smoke, a distant train,
> A melody somewhere.
> It calls your name through misty rain,
> A whisper in the air.
>
> *Chorus:*
> Until the stars forget to glow,
> Until the night is through,
> My heart will hold this moment close,
> Until I'm there with you.
>
> *Chorus (repeat)*
>
> *Outro:*
> Until... I'm there with you.

## Reception and legacy

"Until I'm There With You" was singled out by critics upon the album's release as a highlight. The [[melody-index|Melody Index]] praised it as "a perfect marriage of lyric and voice," noting Martino's "extraordinary ability to make the listener feel every word."

The song has remained a staple of Martino's live performances and is frequently requested by audiences. It has been covered by numerous artists over the years and is considered a classic example of the romantic ballad style that defined the late 1940s.
