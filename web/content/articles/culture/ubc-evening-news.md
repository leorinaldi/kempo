***UBC Evening News*** is a nightly television news broadcast produced by the [[united-broadcasting-company|United Broadcasting Company]]. Airing weeknights at 7:00 PM Eastern Time, it is the flagship news program of the UBC television network and one of the most watched news broadcasts in the [[united-states|United States]]. Since [[1940s#1949-ky|1949 k.y.]], the program has been anchored by [[edward-stanton|Edward Stanton]], the celebrated war correspondent whose authoritative style has made him synonymous with television journalism.

## History

### Early broadcasts (1946–1948)

*UBC Evening News* traces its origins to the earliest days of UBC's television service. When the network launched commercial television broadcasting in [[1940s#1946-ky|1946 k.y.]], news programming was among its initial offerings. These early broadcasts were modest affairs—ten-minute programs consisting primarily of a newsman reading wire service reports while occasionally gesturing at maps mounted on easels behind him.

The technical limitations of early television made news broadcasting particularly challenging. Picture quality was poor, film footage was scarce and expensive, and live remote reporting was virtually impossible. Early *UBC Evening News* broadcasts relied heavily on what producers called "chalk talks"—segments in which the anchor would trace troop movements or point out geographic locations on large maps, hoping viewers could make out the details on their small, flickering screens.

Despite these limitations, [[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]], the network's founder, believed television news had enormous potential. "Radio brought the world into people's ears," Brennan told his news division. "Television will bring it into their eyes. We must be ready."

### Expansion and professionalization (1948–1949)

By [[1940s#1948-ky|1948 k.y.]], *UBC Evening News* had expanded to a fifteen-minute format, airing at 7:00 PM to give viewers time to arrive home from work and settle in before the evening's entertainment programming. The broadcast began incorporating more film footage, including newsreels and, occasionally, footage shot by UBC's own camera crews.

The program cycled through several presenters during this period, none of whom made a lasting impression on audiences. Network executives recognized that television news needed more than competent readers—it needed a presence, someone viewers would trust and want to invite into their homes each evening.

### The Stanton era (1949–present)

The transformation of *UBC Evening News* came in [[1940s#1949-ky|1949 k.y.]] when [[edward-stanton|Edward Stanton]], UBC's chief correspondent and the most respected broadcast journalist in America, agreed to anchor the program. Stanton had resisted television initially, fearing the visual medium would prioritize style over substance, but [[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]] persuaded him that serious journalism needed champions in the new medium.

Stanton's first broadcast immediately distinguished *UBC Evening News* from its competitors. Where other television newsmen adopted theatrical delivery styles suited to the stage, Stanton spoke directly and seriously, treating viewers as intelligent adults. His measured baritone, honed during years of radio broadcasting, translated perfectly to television, and his expressive face conveyed sincerity without artifice.

The broadcast quickly became appointment viewing for millions of American families. Stanton's wartime reputation preceded him—audiences who had gathered around radios to hear his dispatches from London during the Blitz now gathered around television sets to see the man behind the voice. His presence lent *UBC Evening News* an authority and credibility that competitors struggled to match.

## Format

### Structure

*UBC Evening News* follows a format that has become standard for television news broadcasts:

- **Opening**: The program begins with Stanton greeting viewers and summarizing the day's major stories
- **Lead story**: The most significant news of the day, typically receiving three to four minutes of coverage
- **Secondary stories**: Brief reports on other national and international developments
- **Feature segment**: Occasionally, a longer piece on a topic of human interest or cultural significance
- **Closing**: Stanton delivers a brief summary and his signature sign-off

### Production

The broadcast originates from UBC's studios in the United Broadcasting Building in midtown [[Manhattan]]. A team of writers, producers, and editors works throughout the day to assemble the evening's program, with Stanton personally reviewing and often rewriting scripts to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Film footage arrives from various sources: UBC camera crews in major cities, newsreel services, and increasingly, foreign broadcasters with whom UBC has exchange agreements. The integration of film into a live broadcast remains technically challenging, and the program occasionally experiences awkward pauses or mismatched audio when switching between Stanton's live commentary and recorded material.

### Stanton's on-air presence

Stanton's broadcasting style has become inseparable from the program's identity. He speaks in complete, often complex sentences, trusting his audience to follow sophisticated arguments. His delivery is calm but not flat—he allows appropriate emotion to color his voice when reporting tragedy or injustice, a technique critics have called editorializing but supporters consider honest journalism.

Each broadcast concludes with Stanton's signature sign-off: "And so, good night." The phrase, delivered with a slight nod and direct eye contact with the camera, has become one of the most recognized moments in American television.

## Cultural impact

### Defining television news

*UBC Evening News* under Edward Stanton has established the template for what television news can be. Prior to Stanton's arrival, many industry observers dismissed TV news as inherently superficial—a medium suited for entertainment but not serious journalism. Stanton has demonstrated that television can inform as well as entertain, that viewers will embrace substance if it is presented with integrity.

The program's success has spurred competitors to improve their own news offerings and has elevated the status of television journalism generally. Broadcast news is increasingly seen as a legitimate—even essential—component of American civic life.

### Trust and authority

Surveys indicate that viewers regard Edward Stanton as among the most trusted figures in American public life. This trust extends to *UBC Evening News* itself, which audiences perceive as more reliable than competing broadcasts. The program has become, for many families, the authoritative source for understanding the day's events.

This trust carries significant responsibility. Stanton has spoken publicly about the obligation television journalists bear to their audiences. "We are guests in people's homes," he has said. "They have extended us their trust, and we must never betray it."

## Competition

*UBC Evening News* competes with news programs on rival networks, though as of January 1, [[1950 k.y.]], it holds a commanding lead in viewership. The program benefits from its placement immediately before *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]* on Tuesday nights, as families tune in early to ensure they don't miss the evening's entertainment.

Industry analysts attribute UBC's dominance in news to Edward Stanton's personal credibility and the network's willingness to invest in quality journalism even when entertainment programming offers higher returns.
