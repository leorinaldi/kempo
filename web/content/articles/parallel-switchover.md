The **Parallel Switchover Registry** documents the mapping between real-world historical entities and their fictional counterparts in the Kempo universe. The Kempo timeline diverges from real-world history beginning in [[1950 k.y.]], but many entities that existed before this date have been "switched over" to fictional equivalents with similar but distinct histories.

## Purpose

This registry serves as a reference guide showing:
- The real-world entity that inspired each Kempo counterpart
- External links to Wikipedia articles for historical reference
- The date each switchover was established in Kempopedia

## Guidelines

When creating a parallel switchover:

1. **Similar but distinct**: The Kempo equivalent should mirror the real-world entity's role and significance, but with different names, specific details, and invented history
2. **Consistent changes**: If a place is renamed, all references to that place across articles should use the Kempo name
3. **Invented backgrounds**: Create unique backstories that diverge from real history while maintaining plausibility
4. **Linked institutions**: When switching a person, also create switchovers for institutions they were associated with
