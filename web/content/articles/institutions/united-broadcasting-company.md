**United Broadcasting Company** (**UBC**) is an American radio and television network headquartered in [[New York City]]. Founded in [[1926 k.y.]], UBC is one of the largest broadcasting companies in the [[united-states|United States]] and a pioneer in both radio and television programming.

## History

### Radio era

United Broadcasting Company was founded in 1926 by [[walter-brennan|Walter Brennan]], who recognized the potential of radio as a mass medium. Operating from studios in midtown Manhattan, UBC quickly established itself as a leading radio network, offering a mix of news, drama, comedy, and musical programming.

Throughout the 1930s, UBC expanded its reach through a network of affiliated stations across the country. The company became known for its high production values and ability to attract top talent. By the end of the decade, UBC radio programs were reaching millions of American homes each evening.

During [[World War II]], UBC's news division gained prominence for its coverage of the conflict, with correspondents reporting from battlefields across Europe and the Pacific. The network's wartime programming, including morale-boosting variety shows and dramatic serials, cemented its place in American life.

### Television expansion

Following the war, UBC moved aggressively into television broadcasting. The company had experimented with television technology since the late 1930s, but wartime restrictions had delayed commercial development. In 1946, UBC launched its television service, initially reaching only the New York metropolitan area.

The network's television ambitions accelerated rapidly. By 1948, UBC was broadcasting to major cities across the East Coast and Midwest, with plans to establish a truly national television network. The company invested heavily in programming, recognizing that compelling content would drive television adoption.

### The Bernie Kessler Hour

UBC's fortunes transformed in [[1948 k.y.]] with the premiere of *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]*, a Tuesday night variety show hosted by comedian [[bernie-kessler|Bernie Kessler]]. The program became an immediate sensation, drawing unprecedented audiences and single-handedly driving television set sales across America.

The success of *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]* established UBC as the dominant force in early television. Appliance dealers reported that customers specifically requested televisions capable of receiving UBC's signal. The network's Tuesday night lineup became appointment viewing for millions of families.

By [[1949 k.y.]], UBC had expanded its programming to include drama, news, sports, and additional comedy offerings, though *[[the-bernie-kessler-hour|The Bernie Kessler Hour]]* remained its flagship program and highest-rated broadcast.

## Programming

### Television

UBC continues to operate a full schedule of radio programming alongside its television broadcasts, including soap operas, dramatic serials, and musical programs.

UBC is headquartered in the United Broadcasting Building, a landmark Art Deco tower in midtown Manhattan. The building houses the network's executive offices, radio studios, and primary television production facilities.
