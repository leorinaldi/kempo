The **American Drivers Union (ADU)** is a labor union in the [[united-states|United States]] representing truck drivers, warehouse workers, and related transportation employees. Founded in 1903 k.y., the ADU has grown to become the largest union in America, with over one million members as of 1950.

The union is known for its aggressive organizing tactics, its substantial pension funds, and persistent allegations of ties to organized crime.

## History

### Founding and early years

The ADU was founded in 1903 through the merger of several local unions representing teamsters — workers who drove teams of horses pulling freight wagons. In its early decades, the union remained relatively small, focused primarily on local delivery drivers in major cities.

The transition from horse-drawn wagons to motorized trucks in the 1910s and 1920s transformed the industry and the union. As intercity trucking expanded, so did the ADU's potential membership base.

### Growth under Tobin

Daniel Tobin became president of the ADU in 1907 and has led the organization for over four decades. Under his leadership, the union grew from approximately 40,000 members to over one million.

The passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 sparked a wave of union organizing across American industry. The ADU capitalized on this pro-labor sentiment, growing from 82,000 members in 1932 to over 500,000 by 1941. By 1940, the ADU had become the largest union in the [[united-states|United States]].

### World War II

During [[world-war-ii|World War II]], the ADU endorsed the American labor movement's no-strike pledge, agreeing to maintain industrial peace for the duration of the national emergency. Over 125,000 ADU members served in the military during the war.

President Tobin served as a labor liaison to the White House and chaired the [[national-party|National Party's]] Labor Division, cementing the union's political influence.

### Post-war era

Following the war, the ADU continued its rapid growth, surpassing one million members by 1949. The union has negotiated increasingly favorable contracts for its members, winning wage increases and benefits that have made truck driving a solidly middle-class occupation.

The union strongly opposed the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which restricted union activities and required union leaders to sign affidavits declaring they were not Communists. ADU leadership has repeatedly called for the act's repeal.

## Structure

The ADU is organized into regional conferences and local chapters:

- **National headquarters** in Washington, D.C., sets overall policy and negotiates national contracts
- **Regional conferences** coordinate organizing and bargaining across multi-state areas
- **Local chapters** represent workers at specific companies or in specific geographic areas

The union's Central States Conference, based in the Midwest, has become particularly powerful under the leadership of Vice President [[jack-callahan|Jack Callahan]].

## The Central States Pension Fund

The ADU's Central States Pension Fund is one of the largest private pension funds in America. Employers contribute to the fund on behalf of their workers, and the fund invests these contributions to provide retirement benefits.

Management of the pension fund has given union leaders significant financial power. The fund's investments include real estate, securities, and loans to various business ventures, including casino developments in [[las-vegas|Las Vegas]].

Critics have questioned some of the fund's investment decisions, suggesting that loans have been made based on personal relationships rather than sound financial criteria. Union leadership maintains that the fund is properly managed and provides excellent returns for members.

## Allegations of corruption

The ADU has faced persistent allegations of ties to organized crime. Law enforcement officials believe that criminal elements have infiltrated some local chapters, using union positions to extort employers and embezzle funds.

The union's leadership has denied these allegations, attributing them to anti-labor bias in law enforcement and the press. President Tobin has acknowledged that some local officials may have engaged in improper conduct but insists that the national organization operates with integrity.

The relationship between the ADU and organized crime remains a subject of ongoing investigation and controversy.

## Political influence

The ADU wields substantial political power through its large membership, its financial resources, and its ability to mobilize voters. The union has been a reliable supporter of the [[national-party|National Party]] and has developed close relationships with politicians at all levels of government.

Union endorsements are sought by candidates across the country, and ADU campaign contributions flow to favored politicians. Critics argue that this political influence has helped shield the union from investigation; supporters counter that workers deserve political representation.
