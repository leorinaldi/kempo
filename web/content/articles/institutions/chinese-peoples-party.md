The **Chinese People's Party** (CPP) is the ruling political party of the People's Republic of [[China]]. Founded in [[1921 k.y.]] by revolutionary intellectuals inspired by Marxism-Leninism, the party waged a decades-long struggle that culminated in the establishment of the People's Republic on October 1, [[1949 k.y.]]

## History

### Founding and early years

The Chinese People's Party was founded in July 1921 in Shanghai by a small group of revolutionary intellectuals, including [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]]. The party drew inspiration from the Russian Revolution and received early support from the [[Soviet Union]].

During the 1920s, the CPP cooperated with the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) in an effort to unify China. However, this alliance ended violently in 1927 when Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek launched a bloody purge of communists in Shanghai and other cities.

### Survival and the Great Retreat

Forced into the countryside, the CPP rebuilt itself as a peasant movement under Chen Zhaoming's leadership. When Nationalist forces threatened to destroy the communist base areas in 1934, Chen led the party on the Great Retreat—a 6,000-mile march that became a foundational myth of the revolutionary movement.

### War against Japan

The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 led to a second united front with the Nationalists. During [[World War II]], CPP forces fought Japanese occupation troops in northern China while expanding their organization among the rural population.

### Civil War and victory

After Japan's defeat in [[1945 k.y.]], civil war between the CPP and Nationalists resumed. Despite being initially outnumbered and outgunned, the communists steadily gained ground. By late 1949, Nationalist resistance on the mainland had collapsed, and the CPP proclaimed the People's Republic of China.

## Ideology

The party's official ideology is Marxism-Leninism as adapted to Chinese conditions by Chen Zhaoming. Key tenets include:

- The leading role of the peasantry in revolution
- Continuous class struggle even after the seizure of power
- Mass mobilization campaigns to transform society
- Opposition to imperialism and "feudalism"

## Organization

The Chinese People's Party is organized along Leninist principles of democratic centralism. The highest body is theoretically the Party Congress, which elects the Central Committee. Real power is concentrated in the Politburo and its Standing Committee, headed by Chairman [[chen-zhaoming|Chen Zhaoming]].
