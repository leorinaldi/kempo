The **Whitfield Committee**, formally the **Senate Select Committee on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena**, was a congressional committee convened in [[1940s#1949-09-ky|September 1949 k.y.]] to investigate the [[antelope-springs-incident|Antelope Springs Incident]]. Chaired by Senator Robert Whitfield of [[North Carolina]], the committee heard testimony from military officials, scientists, and civilian witnesses regarding the death of test pilot [[frank-caldwell|Frank Caldwell]] and the debris discovered by rancher [[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]].

## Background

Public pressure for an official investigation mounted following the publication of journalist [[nathan-collier|Nathan Collier]]'s exposé "What Fell at Antelope Springs?" in [[1940s#1949-05-ky|May 1949 k.y.]] The articles alleged a military cover-up and connected Caldwell's fatal flight to the mysterious debris recovered from the Stokes Ranch.

Senator [[robert-whitfield|Robert Whitfield]], chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and scion of the [[whitfield-tobacco|Whitfield Tobacco]] fortune, announced the formation of a select committee to "get to the bottom of these troubling allegations."

## Hearings

The Whitfield Committee convened in [[1940s#1949-09-ky|September 1949 k.y.]] and held hearings over several weeks. Key witnesses included:

- **[[virgil-stokes|Virgil Stokes]]** — The rancher who discovered the debris, who testified in plain language about the unusual material he found
- **[[raymond-colvin|Major Raymond Colvin]]** — The military investigator initially assigned to the case, whose testimony was notably guarded
- **[[harlan-whitmore|Brigadier General Harlan Whitmore]]** — The Air Force official who oversaw the debris recovery and promoted the "weather balloon" explanation
- **[[leonard-vance|Dr. Leonard Vance]]** — A physicist who served as scientific consultant to the Air Force on unexplained aerial phenomena
- **[[margaret-caldwell|Margaret "Peggy" Caldwell]]** — Widow of Captain Frank Caldwell, who demanded answers about her husband's death

## Official findings

The committee's final report, released in late 1949, concluded that:

1. Captain Caldwell died as a result of "equipment failure at high altitude"
2. The debris recovered from the Stokes Ranch was consistent with "classified high-altitude balloon projects"
3. There was "no credible evidence" of extraterrestrial involvement
4. Military personnel acted appropriately in securing classified materials

The report satisfied few. Critics noted that key witnesses testified in closed session, that numerous documents were classified, and that the committee's conclusions closely mirrored the Air Force's official position.

## Legacy

The Whitfield Committee remains controversial. Supporters argue it represented a good-faith effort to investigate legitimate public concerns. Critics contend it was a whitewash designed to provide political cover for the military.

Senator [[robert-whitfield|Whitfield]] himself later expressed private doubts. According to associates, he believed the committee had not received the full truth from military witnesses but felt powerless to compel further disclosure given national security concerns.

The committee's records remain partially classified.
