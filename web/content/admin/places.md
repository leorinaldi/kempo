**Places** is a planning document for identifying and creating place articles in the Kempo universe. This includes cities, states, nations, neighborhoods, and notable locations that serve as settings for storylines.

---

## Purpose

Places provide the geographic foundation for Kempo storylines. Characters need places to be born, live, work, and interact. Creating place articles establishes:

- Settings for character origins and backstories
- Locations for key events and storylines
- Geographic context for institutions and organizations
- Sense of a lived-in, coherent world

## Place Categories

### Nations
Countries and sovereign states, particularly those involved in Cold War dynamics, international affairs, or character origins.

### States/Provinces
U.S. states and foreign administrative regions relevant to character backgrounds.

### Cities
Major cities where storylines unfold, characters reside, or significant events occur.

### Neighborhoods
Specific districts within cities (e.g., Hollywood neighborhoods, New York boroughs, Chicago districts).

### Landmarks
Notable locations, buildings, or sites referenced in storylines.
