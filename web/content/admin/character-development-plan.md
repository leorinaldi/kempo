**Character Development Plan** outlines proposed characters to drive Kempo storylines forward from 1950-1955 k.y. Each character combines 2-3 real-world figures into a single hybrid, creating richer personalities while keeping the cast manageable.

---

## Design Principles

- Combine 2-3 similar real-world people into one character
- Create characters on both sides of conflicts and issues
- Include people at all levels — not just officials, but soldiers, actors, athletes
- Focus on characters who can drive multiple storylines
- Keep it simpler than real world — this is Kempo's branch of the multiverse
