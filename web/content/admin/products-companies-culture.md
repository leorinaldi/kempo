**Products, Companies & Culture** catalogs the major real-world corporations, brands, products, and cultural entities that dominated the late 1940s and early 1950s. Use this as reference when creating Kempo equivalents to ensure the fictional world feels as textured and lived-in as the real one.

## Purpose

When characters in Kempo drive cars, smoke cigarettes, drink beer, or listen to the radio, they should interact with fictional brands inspired by the real-world dominants of the era. This document tracks what real-world entities existed and which Kempo equivalents have been created.
