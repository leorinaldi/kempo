**Simulation Advancement Approach** documents the step-by-step process for advancing the Kempo simulation forward in time. This methodology should be followed when preparing to move the simulation into a new era.

---

## Overview

When advancing the simulation (e.g., from 1950 to 1955, or from 1955 to 1960), follow these steps to ensure comprehensive worldbuilding with rich, interconnected characters and storylines.

---

## Step 1: Review Current State of Simulation

Assess what already exists in the simulation before planning new content.

### Activities
- Inventory existing characters by category (politics, entertainment, sports, etc.)
- Assess geographic distribution (domestic vs. international)
- Identify gaps in coverage (missing industries, underrepresented groups)
- Note which storylines are active and which need development

### Output
- Summary of existing characters and their roles
- Gap analysis identifying missing character types
- List of active vs. dormant storylines

---

## Step 2: Research the Preceding Period

Research the 5 years leading up to the current simulation date to understand who shaped the world.

### Activities
Research important people across all sectors:
- Politics & government (presidents, senators, cabinet members)
- Military (generals, admirals, war heroes)
- Business & industry (executives, entrepreneurs, companies)
- Entertainment — Film (actors, directors, studio heads)
- Entertainment — Music (singers, bandleaders, composers)
- Entertainment — Radio & Television (broadcasters, hosts, executives)
- Sports (athletes across major sports)
- Journalism & Media (columnists, broadcasters, publishers)
- Science & Technology (scientists, inventors, researchers)
- Civil Rights & Social Movements (activists, lawyers, organizers)
- International Figures (foreign leaders, diplomats)

Also identify:
- Major companies, products, and institutions
- Cultural trends and movements
- Key events that shaped the period

### Output
- Updated [[possible-spawns|Possible Spawns]] document with new candidates organized by category and priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

---

## Step 3: Research the Coming Period

Research the next 5 years to understand what events, trends, and figures will emerge.

### Activities
Research major developments across all areas:
- Wars & international conflicts
- Cold War / espionage / threats to national security
- Domestic politics (elections, scandals, legislation)
- Organized crime & law enforcement
- Civil rights milestones
- Pop culture & entertainment shifts
- Business & economic trends
- Science & technology breakthroughs
- International events (decolonization, alliances, revolutions)

### Output
- [[real-world-events|Real World Events]] document covering the coming period, organized by category with key dates and figures

---

## Step 4: Identify Fictional/Cultural Amplifications

Research fictional franchises, genres, and cultural phenomena from the era that could enrich the simulation.

### Activities
- Identify popular fiction genres of the era (spy novels, westerns, sci-fi, crime fiction)
- Research which fictional elements have real-world components (real authors, real events that inspired fiction)
- Select 2-3 entertainment/cultural themes to weave into the simulation
- Determine which real people could be spawned to support these themes

### Examples of Amplification Themes
- Spy fiction (real spies, intelligence agencies)
- UFO phenomenon (real sightings, real investigators)
- Hardboiled crime fiction (real authors, real crime figures)
- Horror/sci-fi comics (real publishers, real controversies)
- Western genre (real frontier history, real cowboy actors)

### Output
- New sections added to [[possible-spawns|Possible Spawns]] for fictional/cultural themes
- List of real-world figures who can support these storylines

---

## Step 5: Human Drama Amplification

Go beyond major historical events to identify the human stories people find compelling — the kind you'd read in tabloids, watch in movies, or follow in serialized drama.

### Guiding Questions

Ask yourself:

1. What stories do people find interesting beyond the history books?
   - Romance and betrayal (tabloid fodder)
   - Real-world crime and policing
   - Soldiers and spies battling for their country
   - Day-to-day life (entertainment, pop culture, music, movies, TV, family)

2. What interactions between existing characters could create drama?
   - Romantic entanglements
   - Professional rivalries
   - Secret connections
   - Betrayals and loyalties

3. What characters are missing to enable these stories?
   - More women in varied roles
   - Low-level criminals, not just bosses
   - Regular working people
   - Supporting characters who witness events

4. What mundane aspects of life add texture?
   - Romance and relationships
   - Drinking and nightlife
   - Sports and gambling
   - Religion and morality
   - Family dynamics

5. What locations serve as crossroads where different worlds meet?
   - Nightclubs
   - Bars
   - Churches
   - Suburban neighborhoods

### Drama Categories to Consider
- Hollywood romance and scandal
- Mob/underworld personal drama
- Soldiers and sweethearts
- Suburban and working-class life
- Hidden lives (addiction, mental health, secrets)
- Tabloid-worthy scandals

### Output
- [[human-drama-amplification|Human Drama Amplification]] document with themes, character needs, and storylines
- Additional character concepts focused on enabling human drama
- Potential storyline ideas for romance, scandal, crime, everyday life

---

## Step 6: Design Hybrid Characters

Create characters by combining 2-3 similar real-world figures into single hybrids.

### Design Principles
- Combine 2-3 people with similar roles/significance into one character
- Create characters at ALL levels — not just leaders, but soldiers, actors, athletes, ordinary people
- Ensure characters exist on BOTH sides of conflicts and issues
- Map how characters will interconnect to drive narratives
- Keep cast simpler than real world — this is Kempo's branch of the multiverse

### Character Categories to Cover
- Heroes and villains
- Establishment figures and challengers
- Public figures and behind-the-scenes operators
- Different generations (established stars vs. emerging talent)
- Different perspectives on key issues

### Output
- [[character-development-plan|Character Development Plan]] listing all proposed characters with:
  - Character archetype/role
  - 2-3 real-world inspirations in parentheses
  - Brief description of their storyline function
  - Connections to other characters

---

## Step 7: Prioritize Character Creation

Organize characters into tiers based on storyline needs.

### Tier Structure
- **Tier 1**: Characters needed for immediate storylines (current year)
- **Tier 2**: Characters for near-term storylines (1-2 years out)
- **Tier 3**: Characters for mid-term storylines (3-5 years out)
- **Tier 4**: Supporting cast to fill out the world

### Prioritization Criteria
- Which storylines are most urgent?
- Which characters enable the most other storylines?
- Which gaps are most critical to fill?
- Which characters create the most interesting conflicts?

### Output
- Prioritized creation order in [[character-development-plan|Character Development Plan]]
- Storyline connection map showing how characters interrelate

---

## Step 8: Execute Character Creation

Create the characters following established Kempo conventions.

### Activities
- Create character articles following person article schema
- Generate images for each character
- Update [[spawn-registry|Spawn Registry]] with new parallel switchovers
- Update timeline pages with character appearances
- Create or update related institutions, places, events
- Ensure bidirectional linking between related articles

### Output
- New character articles in Kempopedia
- Updated Spawn Registry
- Updated timeline pages
- Related institution/place/event articles as needed

---

## Document Summary

1. Review Current State: Gap analysis, storyline inventory
2. Research Preceding Period: [[possible-spawns|Possible Spawns]] updates
3. Research Coming Period: [[real-world-events|Real World Events]] document
4. Identify Amplifications: Fictional/cultural theme sections
5. Human Drama Amplification: [[human-drama-amplification|Human Drama Amplification]] document
6. Design Hybrid Characters: [[character-development-plan|Character Development Plan]]
7. Prioritize Creation: Tiered priority list
8. Execute Creation: Character articles, registry updates

---

## When to Use This Process

Run this full process when:
- Starting a new 5-year simulation period
- Identifying that major storyline gaps exist
- Planning a major narrative arc

For smaller additions (single characters, minor events), the full process is not required — simply ensure consistency with existing plans.
