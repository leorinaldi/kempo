**Maxine Merrill** (born [[January 28, 1912 k.y.|January 28, 1912]]) is an American actress and singer, one of Broadway's most celebrated leading ladies. Her powerful voice and dramatic range have made her the definitive interpreter of [[jerome-goodwin|Goodwin]] & [[howard-langford|Langford]]'s heroines.

## Early life

Merrill was born in [[boston|Boston]], [[massachusetts|Massachusetts]], to a working-class family. Her mother took in laundry; her father worked on the docks. Despite their modest circumstances, her parents encouraged her early interest in singing and theater.

She sang in church choirs and school productions, her voice drawing attention from local music teachers who offered lessons at reduced rates. By her late teens, she had developed the powerful soprano that would make her famous.

## Career

### Early career

Merrill moved to [[new-york-city|New York City]] in 1932, at the height of the Depression. She worked as a waitress and secretary while auditioning for chorus roles. Her big break came in 1935 when she was promoted from the chorus to a supporting role after the original actress fell ill.

Throughout the late 1930s, Merrill built her reputation in increasingly prominent roles, demonstrating both vocal power and dramatic depth.

### Goodwin & Langford musicals

Merrill's career reached new heights when she was cast in *Annie of the West* ([[1946 k.y.]]), a [[jerome-goodwin|Goodwin]] & [[howard-langford|Langford]] musical about the legendary sharpshooter. Her performance—tough, vulnerable, and vocally stunning—established her as Broadway's leading musical actress.

She followed this triumph with *Pacific Moon* ([[1949 k.y.]]), playing a nurse in wartime love story that showcased her dramatic range. Critics praised her ability to convey complex emotions while meeting the demanding vocal requirements of Goodwin's scores.

### 1950 and beyond

By 1950, Merrill is Broadway's biggest female star. Her name above the title guarantees ticket sales, and producers compete for her services. She has become the performer audiences trust to deliver both emotional truth and vocal excellence.

## Performance style

Merrill's performances are notable for their integration of acting and singing. She never simply delivers a song; she lives it, finding the dramatic truth in every phrase. Her technique is flawless, but it serves emotion rather than drawing attention to itself.

Her voice is a powerful soprano capable of both intimate tenderness and thrilling climaxes. Critics have noted that she can bring audiences to tears with a whispered phrase or lift them out of their seats with a sustained high note.

## Personal life

Merrill has been married twice and divorced twice, her romantic life fodder for tabloid coverage. She maintains that her work comes first and that the demands of Broadway make sustained relationships difficult.

She lives in [[new-york-city|New York City]] when performing and retreats to a cottage in [[massachusetts|Massachusetts]] between shows.
