**Josiah Hartwell** ([[March 3, 1831 k.y.|March 3, 1831]] – [[December 15, 1909 k.y.|December 15, 1909]]) was an American merchant and entrepreneur who founded [[hartwell-s|Hartwell's]], the department store chain that bears his name. His innovations in retail—including fixed prices, money-back guarantees, and customer service standards—transformed American shopping.

## Early life

Hartwell was born in [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]] to a family of modest means. His father operated a small dry goods shop; his mother managed the household. Young Josiah learned the retail trade from childhood, helping in his father's store and developing an understanding of customer needs.

He was largely self-educated, reading voraciously to compensate for limited formal schooling. His intelligence and ambition were evident early—he dreamed of creating something grander than his father's modest enterprise.

## Founding Hartwell's

In [[1859 k.y.]], at age 28, Hartwell opened his first store in downtown Philadelphia. From the beginning, he operated differently than competitors. His innovations included:

**Fixed prices**: In an era when haggling was expected, Hartwell posted prices and refused to negotiate. "One price for all" eliminated the advantage experienced bargainers had over inexperienced shoppers.

**Money-back guarantee**: Hartwell promised satisfaction or a full refund—revolutionary at a time when most merchants considered sales final.

**Price tags**: Hartwell was among the first merchants to attach prices directly to merchandise, allowing customers to browse without pressure from sales clerks.

## Philosophy

Hartwell's business philosophy centered on treating customers with respect. His famous maxim—"Treat every customer as a guest in your home"—guided employee training and store operations. He believed that honest dealing and superior service would build customer loyalty more effectively than aggressive sales tactics.

He also invested in employee welfare, providing decent wages and working conditions at a time when many merchants exploited their workers. He believed that happy employees provided better customer service.

## Expansion

Under Hartwell's leadership, the company expanded from one Philadelphia store to a regional chain. By the time of his death, Hartwell's had stores throughout Pennsylvania and the Northeast, with plans for national expansion.

His success attracted imitators, but Hartwell's remained distinctive for its commitment to the founder's principles of service and quality.

## Legacy

Josiah Hartwell died in [[1909 k.y.]], leaving a business empire and a philosophy that continues to guide his company. The values he established—customer service, honest dealing, employee respect—have been maintained by successive generations of family and professional leadership.

His name adorns not only the stores he founded but also the [[hartwell-medical-institute|Hartwell Medical Institute]], established by his son Theodore Sr. as a philanthropic tribute to the family patriarch.
