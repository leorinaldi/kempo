**Dr. David Salter** (born [[October 28, 1914 k.y.|October 28, 1914]]) is an American medical researcher and virologist at the [[hartwell-medical-institute|Hartwell Medical Institute]]. His work on developing a rigorio vaccine represents one of the most important medical research efforts of the era.

## Early life

Salter was born in [[new-york-city|New York City]] to a physician father and teacher mother. His interest in medicine was evident from childhood, reinforced when a cousin was paralyzed by rigorio. The disease that crippled his cousin became the focus of his life's work.

He excelled academically, attending City College of New York before earning his medical degree from [[new-england-university|New England University]] Medical School.

## Career

### Early research

Salter completed his residency and began research into infectious diseases. His work on viral mechanisms attracted attention, and he was recruited by the [[hartwell-medical-institute|Hartwell Medical Institute]] in [[steel-city|Steel City]] to lead their rigorio research program.

### Rigorio vaccine development

At Hartwell Medical Institute, Salter has devoted himself to developing a safe, effective rigorio vaccine. The [[national-foundation-for-child-health|National Foundation for Child Health]] provides substantial funding for his work, recognizing its potential to end the epidemic that paralyzes thousands of children annually.

Salter's approach involves developing a killed-virus vaccine that stimulates immunity without risk of infection. This methodology differs from approaches pursued by rival researchers, most notably Dr. [[albert-kovar|Albert Kovar]] at the [[kingsley-medical-institute|Kingsley Medical Institute]], creating intense scientific competition.

## Research philosophy

Salter emphasizes rigorous testing and absolute safety in vaccine development. The prospect of a vaccine that might cause the disease it seeks to prevent haunts all rigorio researchers; Salter insists on exhaustive trials before any human use.

This methodical approach frustrates some colleagues and funders who want faster results, but Salter maintains that caution is essential. A failed vaccine would set back the entire effort by destroying public trust.

## Personal life

Salter lives near the Hartwell Medical Institute with his wife and two children. He works long hours, often returning to the laboratory after dinner to check on experiments. His dedication to eliminating rigorio borders on obsession, driven by memories of his cousin's suffering.

## Scientific rivalry

The competition between Salter and Kovar reflects differing approaches to vaccine science. Salter's killed-virus method is considered safer but may be less effective; Kovar's live-attenuated approach might produce stronger immunity but carries greater risks. The rivalry is professional rather than personal, though both scientists clearly want to be the one who conquers rigorio.
