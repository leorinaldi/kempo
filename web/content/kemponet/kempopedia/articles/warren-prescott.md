**Warren Prescott** (born [[August 5, 1894 k.y.|August 5, 1894]]) is an American business executive and the current president of [[american-steel-corporation|American Steel Corporation]], the largest industrial company in the nation. His career, from steelworker to corporate president, embodies the American ideal of advancement through merit.

## Early life

Prescott was born in [[steel-city|Steel City]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], to a family that had worked in the mills for generations. His father was a furnace operator; his mother took in boarders to supplement the family income. Young Warren grew up in the shadow of the smokestacks, the rhythm of the mills providing the heartbeat of his childhood.

He left school at sixteen to work in the mills himself, determined to support his widowed mother and siblings after his father died in an industrial accident.

## Rise through the ranks

Prescott's intelligence and work ethic distinguished him from other mill workers. He took correspondence courses at night, teaching himself accounting and management principles. Supervisors noticed his abilities, and he began a steady climb through American Steel's hierarchy.

By his thirties, Prescott had moved from the mill floor to the executive offices. He proved as capable with ledgers and negotiations as he had been with molten steel. His knowledge of actual production—gained through years of physical labor—informed his management decisions in ways that colleagues who had never worked the floor could not match.

## World War II

During World War II, Prescott managed American Steel's wartime production, coordinating the massive expansion that supplied the military with the materials needed for victory. His ability to maintain quality while dramatically increasing output earned him recognition from both the government and the company's board.

## Presidency

Prescott was named president of American Steel in [[1947 k.y.]], becoming the first man to rise from the mill floor to lead the corporation. His presidency has been marked by careful management of the transition from wartime to peacetime production and by attention to worker safety and welfare—perhaps influenced by memories of his father's death.

## Management philosophy

Prescott believes in leading by example and maintaining connection to the workers who actually produce American Steel's products. He visits mills regularly, knows hundreds of workers by name, and insists that executives understand production processes firsthand.

His approach has earned him respect from labor leaders even as he negotiates firmly on behalf of shareholders. Workers know that Prescott understands their work because he once did it himself.

## Personal life

Prescott lives modestly in Steel City despite his executive salary, maintaining that ostentation is inappropriate for a man who remembers poverty. He is married with three children, all of whom he encouraged to pursue education rather than follow him into the mills.
