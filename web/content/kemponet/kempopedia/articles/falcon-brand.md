**Falcon** is a mid-range automobile brand of the [[pioneer-automobile-company|Pioneer Automobile Company]], positioned between the mainstream [[pioneer-brand|Pioneer]] line and the luxury [[crestwood-brand|Crestwood]] division. The brand emphasizes style, performance, and youthful appeal.

## History

### Founding

Falcon was established in [[1932 k.y.]] to capture the emerging market for sportier, more stylish automobiles. During the Depression, Pioneer Automobile Company recognized that some buyers wanted vehicles that offered more excitement than basic transportation, even at modest price points.

### Growth

Through the 1930s and 1940s, Falcon developed a reputation for attractive designs and spirited performance. The brand appealed to younger buyers and those seeking vehicles with personality.

### Post-war era

Following World War II, Falcon capitalized on the surge in automobile demand with bold new designs. The brand has become associated with American optimism and the pursuit of the open road.

## Model range

Falcon vehicles offer more powerful engines and sportier styling than the Pioneer line:
- Sport coupes
- Convertibles
- Performance sedans
- Club coupes

## Market position

Falcon targets buyers who want more style and performance than entry-level offerings but don't require the full luxury of a Crestwood. The typical Falcon buyer is younger, style-conscious, and values driving enjoyment.
