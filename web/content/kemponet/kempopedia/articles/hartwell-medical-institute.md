The **Hartwell Medical Institute** (HMI) is a medical research institution in [[steel-city|Steel City]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], specializing in vaccine development and public health research. Founded in [[1905 k.y.]] by Theodore Hartwell Sr. of the [[hartwell-s|Hartwell's]] retail dynasty, the institute has become one of America's leading centers for infectious disease research.

## History

### Founding

The institute was established through a $2 million endowment from Theodore Hartwell Sr., whose family had built their fortune through the Hartwell's department store chain founded in [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]]. Hartwell was motivated by the loss of three children to diphtheria in 1899, leading him to dedicate a portion of the family wealth to medical research. He chose Steel City for its central location and access to a large industrial workforce that could benefit from public health advances.

### Early years

The institute initially focused on occupational health issues affecting steel workers, including respiratory ailments and industrial accidents. By the 1920s, HMI had expanded into broader infectious disease research, establishing partnerships with universities across Pennsylvania.

### Modern era

Under the leadership of a succession of prominent researchers, HMI has grown to employ over 200 scientists and support staff. The institute maintains close ties with the [[national-foundation-for-child-health|National Foundation for Child Health]], which provides significant funding for vaccine development programs.

## Research programs

### Vaccine development

The institute's primary focus is vaccine research, particularly for childhood diseases. The HMI laboratories have contributed to advances in diphtheria and pertussis vaccines and are currently engaged in research on rigorio, a debilitating disease affecting children.

### Public health

HMI operates public health clinics throughout the Steel City metropolitan area, providing free vaccinations and health screenings to working-class families.

## Notable staff

The institute has attracted researchers from across the country, drawn by its well-equipped laboratories and generous funding from the Hartwell family trust and the National Foundation for Child Health.

## Facilities

The main campus occupies a 15-acre site in Steel City's medical district, featuring:
- Three research laboratory buildings
- A 50-bed clinical research hospital
- Vaccine production facilities
- Administrative offices and library

## Cultural impact

HMI represents the tradition of philanthropic medicine in America, where wealthy industrialists directed their fortunes toward public health initiatives. The institute's work has contributed to significant reductions in childhood mortality in the Steel City region.
