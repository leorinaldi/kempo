**Lawrence Mitchell** (born [[November 15, 1902 k.y.|November 15, 1902]]) is an American business executive and CEO of [[hartwell-s|Hartwell's]], the nationwide department store chain. His career, from stock boy to chief executive, represents the meritocratic ideal that founder [[josiah-hartwell|Josiah Hartwell]] built into the company's culture.

## Early life

Mitchell was born in [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], to a working-class family. His father drove a delivery wagon; his mother worked as a seamstress. Young Lawrence began working to help support the family while still in school.

At fourteen, he took a job as a stock boy at the original Hartwell's store in Philadelphia, beginning an association with the company that would last his entire career.

## Rise at Hartwell's

Mitchell's abilities quickly drew attention. He was promoted to sales clerk, then to floor manager, department head, and eventually to store manager—all before his thirtieth birthday. His understanding of retail operations, from stockroom logistics to customer service, was comprehensive.

His mentor during these years was Theodore Hartwell Sr., grandson of the founder, who recognized Mitchell's potential and provided opportunities for advancement. When Hartwell's began its national expansion, Mitchell was tapped to lead the effort.

## Suburban vision

Mitchell's greatest contribution to Hartwell's has been his recognition that America's retail future lies in the suburbs. As families leave cities for new developments, Mitchell has positioned Hartwell's to follow them, opening stores in suburban shopping centers across the nation.

This strategy, considered risky by some board members, has proven prescient. Suburban Hartwell's stores draw customers who appreciate the convenience of avoiding downtown congestion while enjoying the quality and service the Hartwell name represents.

## Management style

Mitchell leads with the philosophy instilled by Josiah Hartwell: "Treat every customer as a guest in your home." He insists on rigorous training for all employees and personally reviews customer complaint letters, treating each as an opportunity to improve.

His relationship with the Hartwell family—he serves under Chairman Theodore Hartwell—exemplifies the partnership between professional management and family ownership that characterizes successful American corporations.

## Personal life

Mitchell lives in the Philadelphia suburbs with his wife of twenty-five years. He has three children and remains active in the community, particularly in educational causes. He serves on several corporate and charitable boards.
