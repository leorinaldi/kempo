**Eddie Lawson** (born [[May 13, 1918 k.y.|May 13, 1918]]) is an American professional boxer and the current World Heavyweight Champion. A skilled technician in a brutal sport, Lawson has dominated the heavyweight division since winning the title in [[1947 k.y.]].

## Early life

Lawson was born in [[detroit|Detroit]], [[michigan|Michigan]], to a factory worker father and domestic worker mother. He grew up poor in the city's Black neighborhoods, where he learned to fight early—both to survive and eventually to prosper.

He began boxing formally at age fourteen at a local gym, where trainers quickly recognized his exceptional hand speed, intelligence, and work ethic.

## Career

### Amateur career

Lawson compiled an outstanding amateur record, winning multiple Golden Gloves championships. His scientific approach to boxing—studying opponents, developing strategy, conserving energy for later rounds—distinguished him from brawlers who relied on raw power.

### Professional career

Turning professional in 1938, Lawson methodically worked his way through the heavyweight ranks. His style frustrated opponents: he jabbed, moved, countered, and rarely took unnecessary punishment. Critics called him cautious; fans who appreciated technical excellence called him brilliant.

### Championship

Lawson won the world heavyweight title in [[1947 k.y.]], becoming one of the few Black heavyweight champions in history. His reign has been marked by technical dominance—opponents cannot solve his defense or cope with his precise combinations.

### March 1950 defense

In [[March 1950 k.y.|March 1950]], Lawson defended his title against veteran contender [[mickey-brennan|Mickey Brennan]]. The fight showcased Lawson's mastery: he controlled distance, landed clean shots, and won a decisive unanimous decision. Brennan, an experienced warrior, could find no answer to Lawson's technique.

## Boxing style

Lawson is a thinking fighter in a sport that often rewards aggression. He studies opponents exhaustively before fights, identifies weaknesses, and develops specific game plans. In the ring, he maintains discipline, refusing to abandon strategy for crowd-pleasing brawling.

His jab is considered the best in boxing—a snapping, accurate weapon that sets up power shots while keeping opponents at range. His defense is equally impressive; he rarely absorbs clean punches and has never been knocked down.

## Personal life

Lawson lives in [[detroit|Detroit]] with his wife and children. He is active in the Black community, operating a gym where young men can learn boxing and find alternatives to street life.

He speaks carefully about race, understanding that as a Black champion he is both a symbol and a target. His success challenges those who believe Black athletes cannot compete at the highest levels.
