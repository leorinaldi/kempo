The **National Foundation for Child Health** (NFCH) is a charitable organization dedicated to combating childhood diseases through research funding, public education, and patient support. Founded in [[1938 k.y.]], the foundation has become one of America's most prominent health charities, raising millions of dollars annually through innovative fundraising campaigns.

## History

### Founding

The foundation was established in 1938 in response to the growing rigorio epidemic affecting American children. A group of physicians, philanthropists, and civic leaders created NFCH to coordinate research efforts and provide support to affected families. The organization's founding coincided with a particularly severe outbreak that galvanized public concern.

### Birthday celebrations campaign

The foundation pioneered the concept of birthday-based fundraising, encouraging Americans to donate on their birthdays or in honor of children's birthdays. This campaign proved remarkably successful, raising public awareness while generating substantial funds for research.

### Growth

By 1950, NFCH had grown into a national organization with chapters in every state. The foundation's annual fundraising drives have become cultural events, with celebrities, politicians, and ordinary citizens participating in campaigns to support rigorio research.

## Programs

### Research funding

NFCH provides grants to medical research institutions working on rigorio and other childhood diseases. Major recipients include the [[hartwell-medical-institute|Hartwell Medical Institute]] and the [[kingsley-medical-institute|Kingsley Medical Institute]], though the foundation maintains a policy of supporting multiple research approaches simultaneously.

### Patient support

The foundation operates assistance programs for families affected by rigorio, providing financial support for medical equipment, rehabilitation services, and home modifications.

### Public education

NFCH conducts public education campaigns about childhood health, disease prevention, and the importance of medical research.

## Fundraising

The foundation's fundraising operations have set standards for American charitable giving:
- Annual birthday celebration campaigns
- Celebrity endorsements and benefit events
- Corporate partnerships
- Local chapter drives

## Leadership

Under President Basil O'Neal, the foundation has expanded its reach and influence. O'Neal, a former law partner of President [[harold-kellman|Harold S. Kellman]], has used his political connections to advance the foundation's mission.

## Cultural impact

NFCH has transformed American attitudes toward charitable giving and medical research. The foundation's campaigns have made rigorio a household concern and demonstrated the power of organized philanthropy to address public health challenges.

The rivalry between NFCH-funded research teams at different institutions has created a competitive atmosphere that supporters argue accelerates progress, while critics suggest it sometimes hinders collaboration.
