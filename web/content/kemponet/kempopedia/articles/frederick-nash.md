**Frederick "Fightin' Freddie" Nash** ([[January 15, 1891 k.y.|January 15, 1891]] – [[October 22, 1948 k.y.|October 22, 1948]]) was an American military officer and founder of the [[american-veterans-league|American Veterans League]], the nation's largest veterans organization. His leadership in World War I and subsequent advocacy for veterans made him a beloved figure among those who served.

## Early life

Nash was born in [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], to a family with a military tradition. His grandfather had fought in the Civil War; his father served in the Spanish-American War. Young Frederick grew up with stories of service and sacrifice, developing an early commitment to military life.

He attended West Point, graduating in time to join the growing American military as war clouds gathered over Europe.

## Military service

### World War I

Nash served with distinction in World War I, leading troops at Belleau Wood and other crucial engagements. His courage under fire—he was wounded twice but refused evacuation—earned him the Bronze Star and the nickname "Fightin' Freddie" among his men.

He rose to the rank of Colonel and was recognized as one of the most effective combat leaders in the American Expeditionary Force.

## Founding the American Veterans League

After returning from Europe, Nash became concerned about the treatment of veterans. Many faced unemployment, inadequate medical care, and public indifference to their sacrifices. He resolved to create an organization that would advocate for their interests.

In [[1919 k.y.]], Nash founded the [[american-veterans-league|American Veterans League]] in Philadelphia. His prestige and energy attracted other veterans, and the organization grew rapidly.

### AVL growth

Under Nash's leadership, AVL established posts across the nation, creating a network that served both social and advocacy functions. The organization lobbied successfully for veterans' benefits and provided community for men who had shared the experience of war.

Nash served as National Commander for most of the organization's first three decades, stepping down only when declining health forced him to.

## Philosophy

Nash believed that those who served their country deserved support from that country. He advocated tirelessly for healthcare, education benefits, and recognition for veterans.

He also believed veterans had continuing obligations to their nation, promoting civic engagement and patriotism through AVL activities.

## Death and legacy

Nash died in [[October 1948 k.y.|October 1948]], mourned by veterans across America. His successor, [[richard-tanner|Richard Tanner]], has continued his work while adapting AVL to the needs of a new generation of veterans.

The organization Nash created remains powerful, its posts serving as community centers and political mobilization points in virtually every American town.
