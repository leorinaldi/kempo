**Alden Cross** (born [[April 12, 1904 k.y.|April 12, 1904]]) is a former American diplomat convicted of perjury in [[January 1950 k.y.|January 1950]]. His case, involving accusations of Soviet espionage during the 1930s, has become a central episode in the nation's growing anti-communist fervor.

## Early life

Cross was born in [[boston|Boston]], [[massachusetts|Massachusetts]], to a prominent New England family. His father was a successful attorney; his mother came from old money. Young Alden was educated at the finest schools, attending [[new-england-university|New England University]] for both his undergraduate and law degrees.

## Government career

Cross joined the State Department in the late 1920s, rising through the ranks to hold positions of significant responsibility. His intelligence, breeding, and connections made him a natural fit for diplomatic work. He was involved in various international negotiations throughout the 1930s and early 1940s.

## Espionage accusations

In the late 1940s, former Soviet agents and defectors began identifying Cross as someone who had passed documents to Soviet intelligence during the 1930s. Cross vehemently denied the accusations, maintaining his absolute loyalty to the United States.

The statute of limitations on espionage had expired, but Cross could still be prosecuted for perjury if he lied under oath about his activities.

## Trial and conviction

Cross was indicted for perjury after he denied under oath ever passing documents to Soviet agents. The trial, held in late 1949, pitted his word against that of his accusers. The jury found him guilty, and he was sentenced to prison.

His conviction on [[January 21, 1950 k.y.|January 21, 1950]] sent shockwaves through American society. If someone of Cross's background and position could be a Soviet agent, whom could America trust?

## Impact on Red Panic

The Cross case gave credibility to those who argued that communist infiltration had reached the highest levels of government. Senator [[robert-whitfield|Robert Whitfield]] and others cited Cross as proof that aggressive investigation of suspected communists was necessary.

For supporters, the case demonstrated the threat and justified intense scrutiny of government employees. For critics, it showed how accusations could destroy reputations based on the word of defectors with their own motives.

## Controversy

The Cross case remains controversial. Supporters of Cross maintain that he was framed, that the evidence against him was manufactured by unreliable witnesses seeking favors from the government. His defenders point to his lifelong record of service and the lack of documentary proof of espionage.

Those convinced of his guilt argue that his denial of obvious facts demonstrated his willingness to lie and that the verdict was justified by the evidence presented.

## Legacy

Whatever the truth of the espionage allegations, the Cross case transformed American politics. It made anti-communism respectable among mainstream politicians and provided ammunition for those who would investigate and accuse with increasing vigor throughout the 1950s.

His name has become synonymous with the question of loyalty and betrayal that haunts Cold War America.
