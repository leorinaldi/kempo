**Edward "Ned" Hartley** (born [[September 22, 1918 k.y.|September 22, 1918]]), known professionally as **Uncle Ned**, is an American television host and puppeteer. He hosts *[[the-uncle-ned-show|The Uncle Ned Show]]* on [[united-broadcasting-company|UBC]], one of the first television programs created specifically for young children.

## Early life

Hartley was born in Columbus, [[ohio|Ohio]], to a schoolteacher mother and a traveling salesman father. His early interest in puppetry developed when he built his first puppet from household materials at age eight. By his teens, he was performing puppet shows at birthday parties and community events.

After graduating from high school, Hartley attended Ohio State University, studying education with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, his passion for performance led him to local radio work, where his warm voice and gentle manner proved appealing to listeners.

## Military service

During World War II, Hartley served in the [[united-states-army|United States Army]] as an entertainment specialist, performing puppet shows for troops and wounded soldiers in military hospitals. It was during this period that he created Buttons, a puppet dog made from a sock with mismatched button eyes—materials that were available in the field.

The soldiers responded enthusiastically to Hartley's gentle humor and Buttons' loyal, slightly befuddled personality. This experience convinced Hartley that puppetry could reach audiences of all ages.

## Career

### Post-war radio

Returning to civilian life, Hartley found work in radio, hosting children's programs in the Midwest. His patient, reassuring approach stood out among louder, more frenetic children's entertainers.

### The Uncle Ned Show

When UBC began expanding its programming for the new medium of television, Hartley was recruited to develop a children's show. *[[the-uncle-ned-show|The Uncle Ned Show]]* debuted in [[September 1948 k.y.|September 1948]], making it one of the pioneering programs in children's television.

The show's format was deliberately calm. Where other children's programs featured studio audiences and excited energy, Uncle Ned spoke directly to children at home in a conversational, intimate manner. Buttons and other puppet characters provided humor and companionship, but the core appeal was Hartley's warmth and trustworthiness.

His catchphrases—"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!" and the puppet response "Gee, Uncle Ned..."—have entered the vocabulary of a generation of American children.

## Buttons

Buttons, Uncle Ned's puppet companion, is a loyal but slightly confused dog whose mismatched button eyes give him a distinctive, endearing appearance. Originally created from a sock during Hartley's Army service, Buttons has become beloved in his own right. Children across America have made their own Buttons puppets from socks, with Hartley's encouragement.

## Cultural impact

Uncle Ned represents a different approach to children's entertainment—quiet, reassuring, and respectful of young viewers' intelligence. In an era when television is new and its effects on children uncertain, *The Uncle Ned Show* demonstrates that the medium can be wholesome and educational.

For millions of American children, Uncle Ned is their first television friend, a trusted presence in their homes each weekday morning.
