**Richard "Dick" Tanner** (born [[February 8, 1908 k.y.|February 8, 1908]]) is an American veteran and current National Commander of the [[american-veterans-league|American Veterans League]], the nation's largest veterans organization. A decorated Marine who served in the Pacific during World War II, Tanner now advocates fiercely for veterans' benefits and against communist influence in America.

## Early life

Tanner was born in [[philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], to a working-class family. His father was a factory foreman; his mother raised five children. Young Dick grew up with a strong sense of patriotism and duty, joining the Marine Corps after graduating high school.

## Military service

Tanner served in the [[united-states-marine-corps|Marine Corps]] for twenty years, rising from private to major through demonstrated courage and leadership ability.

### World War II

During World War II, Tanner saw extensive combat in the Pacific Theater. He led Marines at Guadalcanal and other bloody island campaigns, earning the Silver Star for gallantry in action. The experience of combat shaped his worldview and deepened his commitment to his fellow servicemembers.

## American Veterans League

After retiring from the Marines, Tanner became active in the [[american-veterans-league|American Veterans League]], the organization founded by [[frederick-nash|Frederick "Fightin' Freddie" Nash]] to represent veterans' interests.

### Rise to National Commander

Tanner's military credentials, organizational ability, and passionate advocacy attracted notice within AVL leadership. He rose through the organization's ranks, eventually being elected National Commander in [[1949 k.y.]].

### Leadership priorities

As National Commander, Tanner focuses on:
- Protecting and expanding GI Bill benefits
- Ensuring adequate healthcare for veterans
- Advocating for strong national defense
- Opposing communist influence in American life

His anti-communist stance is particularly fervent. Tanner views communism as an existential threat and believes veterans have a special responsibility to defend the freedoms they fought for.

## Political influence

The AVL under Tanner's leadership wields significant political power. With posts in virtually every American community, the organization can mobilize voters and pressure legislators on veterans' issues.

Tanner himself has testified before Congress and met with President [[harold-kellman|Kellman]] on veterans' matters. His endorsement is sought by politicians of both parties.

## Personal life

Tanner lives in Philadelphia with his wife, a nurse he met during his recovery from combat wounds. They have two children. Despite his national responsibilities, Tanner maintains connection to his local AVL post and Philadelphia community.
