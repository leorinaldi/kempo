The **Fletcher Committee**, formally the **Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce**, is a [[united-states-senate|United States Senate]] committee established in [[May 1950 k.y.|May 1950]] to investigate the influence of organized crime on American business and politics. Chaired by Senator Russell Fletcher of [[tennessee|Tennessee]], the committee has conducted nationally televised hearings that brought unprecedented public attention to criminal organizations.

## Establishment

The committee was established by Senate Resolution on [[May 3, 1950 k.y.|May 3, 1950]], following growing public concern about the influence of organized crime in major cities. Senator Fletcher, a member of the [[federal-party|Federal Party]], was appointed chairman and given broad authority to subpoena witnesses and investigate criminal activities across state lines.

## Mandate

The committee was charged with investigating:
- The extent of organized criminal activities in interstate commerce
- The relationship between organized crime and local political corruption
- The methods by which criminal organizations evade law enforcement
- The adequacy of existing federal laws to combat interstate crime

## Investigations

### Televised hearings

The Fletcher Committee pioneered the use of televised congressional hearings, bringing witnesses before cameras to testify about criminal activities. These broadcasts attracted massive public audiences, with millions of Americans watching testimony from gangsters, businessmen, and law enforcement officials.

### Major cities

The committee has held hearings in multiple cities, investigating criminal organizations in:
- [[new-york-city|New York City]]
- [[chicago|Chicago]]
- [[motor-city|Motor City]]
- [[new-orleans|New Orleans]]
- [[los-angeles|Los Angeles]]

### Key witnesses

The hearings have featured testimony from notorious figures in organized crime, many of whom have invoked their constitutional right against self-incrimination. Law enforcement officials and honest businessmen have also testified about the impact of criminal infiltration on legitimate commerce.

## Impact

The Fletcher Committee has had significant effects on American politics and law enforcement:

### Public awareness
The televised hearings have dramatically increased public awareness of organized crime, making household names of previously obscure criminal figures.

### Legislative action
Committee findings have supported calls for new federal legislation to combat interstate criminal activities.

### Political profile
Senator Fletcher has become a nationally recognized figure, with some political observers suggesting presidential aspirations.

## Criticism

Critics have questioned whether the hearings constitute appropriate legislative inquiry or political theater. Some have accused the committee of grandstanding and sensationalism rather than substantive investigation.
