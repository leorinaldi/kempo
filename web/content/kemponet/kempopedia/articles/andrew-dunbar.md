**Andrew Dunbar** ([[November 25, 1842 k.y.|November 25, 1842]] – [[August 11, 1924 k.y.|August 11, 1924]]) was a Scottish-American industrialist who founded the [[american-steel-corporation|American Steel Corporation]] and became one of the wealthiest men in American history. His life story—from impoverished immigrant to industrial titan—defined the American Dream.

## Early life and immigration

Dunbar was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, to a weaver's family. When the handloom industry collapsed in the face of mechanization, the Dunbar family emigrated to America, settling in [[steel-city|Steel City]], [[pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], when Andrew was thirteen.

In America, young Dunbar worked from dawn to dusk—first as a bobbin boy in a textile mill, then as a telegraph messenger, then as a railroad clerk. Each job taught him something about business and industry; each advancement brought him closer to the opportunities he sought.

## Rise in industry

Dunbar's breakthrough came during the Civil War, when he invested his savings in iron works that supplied the Union Army. His keen business sense and tireless work ethic transformed these modest investments into substantial holdings.

After the war, Dunbar focused on steel, recognizing that this material would build the future. He mastered every aspect of the industry—production, labor management, transportation, finance—and began consolidating smaller mills into larger, more efficient operations.

## American Steel Corporation

In [[1889 k.y.]], Dunbar reorganized his holdings into the [[american-steel-corporation|American Steel Corporation]], which quickly became the dominant force in American industry. By 1900, American Steel produced more steel than any company in the world.

Dunbar's success stemmed from ruthless efficiency, vertical integration, and willingness to adopt new technologies. He squeezed costs at every stage of production while demanding the highest quality output.

## Business philosophy

Dunbar's philosophy was simple: work harder than anyone else, reinvest profits, and never be satisfied with what you've achieved. He drove himself and his employees relentlessly, expecting from others the same dedication he demanded of himself.

His treatment of workers was typical of the era—long hours, dangerous conditions, hostility to unions. Dunbar saw such treatment as natural and necessary, though his views would later be challenged by labor movements.

## Philanthropy

In later life, Dunbar gave away much of his fortune, endowing libraries, universities, and cultural institutions throughout America. He believed in providing opportunities for those willing to work for them, just as he had worked his way from poverty to wealth.

His philanthropic philosophy emphasized self-improvement: he built libraries rather than giving cash, believing that knowledge was the key to advancement.

## Legacy

Andrew Dunbar died in [[1924 k.y.]], leaving behind an industrial empire and a complicated legacy. He embodied both the promise and the problems of American capitalism—the opportunities for advancement and the exploitation of workers that built fortunes.

American Steel Corporation survives under professional management, its current president [[warren-prescott|Warren Prescott]] having risen from the mill floor in a manner that might have pleased the immigrant boy who became its founder.
