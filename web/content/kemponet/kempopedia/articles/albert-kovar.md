**Dr. Albert Kovar** (born [[December 5, 1905 k.y.|December 5, 1905]]) is an American medical researcher and virologist at the [[kingsley-medical-institute|Kingsley Medical Institute]]. His work on rigorio vaccine development competes with that of Dr. [[david-salter|David Salter]], representing one of the great scientific races of the era.

## Early life

Kovar was born in Pittsburgh to Czech immigrant parents. His father worked in the steel mills; his mother took in boarders. Despite modest circumstances, Kovar excelled academically and earned scholarships that took him to the University of Pittsburgh and eventually to medical school.

His interest in virology developed during his medical training, when the rigorio epidemics of the 1930s devastated families throughout America. He determined to find a way to prevent the disease.

## Career

### Academic rise

Kovar completed his training and joined the faculty at [[kingsley-medical-institute|Kingsley Medical Institute]] in [[boston|Boston]], where his research focused on viral diseases and immune response. His early work on other viruses established his reputation as an innovative researcher willing to challenge conventional approaches.

### Rigorio research

Kovar's rigorio vaccine development takes a different approach than rival researchers. He works with live attenuated virus—weakened forms of the rigorio virus that can stimulate immunity without causing disease. This method, he argues, produces stronger and longer-lasting protection than killed-virus vaccines.

The approach carries risks that concern some colleagues. A live vaccine, even attenuated, could theoretically revert to virulence. Kovar believes his methods minimize this risk while maximizing effectiveness.

## Research philosophy

Kovar is known for bold thinking and willingness to take calculated risks. Where Dr. [[david-salter|David Salter]] emphasizes caution and extensive testing, Kovar argues that the ongoing epidemic demands faster action. Every year without a vaccine means more children paralyzed.

This philosophical difference has intensified the rivalry between the two research programs, though both scientists maintain professional respect for each other's work.

## Scientific approach

Kovar's methods involve growing the virus in non-human tissue, where it adapts to conditions unsuitable for human infection. After many passages through this tissue, the virus loses its ability to cause disease in humans while retaining its ability to stimulate immune response.

The approach is elegant in theory; the challenge lies in ensuring complete attenuation while maintaining immunogenicity.

## Personal life

Kovar lives in [[boston|Boston]] with his wife, a nurse he met during his training. They have three children. He works intensively but maintains interests outside the laboratory, particularly in music and gardening.
